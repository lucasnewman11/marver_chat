Speaker 1:
Um, I'm not the greatest with names the first time. Your name again Martin Martin and you are Paul. All right, OK, I'll probably ask you that again, uh, he's gonna be offended. Uh, I got a lot of miles on my brain.
Speaker 2:
That's OK. Um, you're you're you're reliable.
Speaker 1:
Uh, well, tell me, can you write a letter to my wife for that I need to do that to her this morning. I'll notarized. Yes, definitely, uh, so. All right, you piqued my interest, um. I'm gonna be very straight up with you. If you have a sales pitch, please leave it outside. sounds good. Alright, I'm a business owner. I'm a contractor. I'm a real estate investor and I'm an electrical contractor as well. So, um, alternative energy, solar, I, I, I understand basic concepts and value. OK, alright, so. Uh, I don't know what approach you had when you came in, but I just, you know, you may want to just make some adjustments if necessary.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, no, it's OK. Everyone's at like a different situation with their house, and I, I just wanna make sure that all your questions are answered and Uh, I have the design ready and if you have any electric usage, we can just plug it in and see what it's doing for you and if it looks cool, like we'll show you how to, you know, get it put up and I just wanna make sure the biggest value I can provide to you is just make sure all your questions are answered.
Speaker 1:
OK, so I'd like to, I guess maybe start with your role because his pitch to me yesterday was to give free solar and I told him there's nothing for nothing. Nothing is stress and that's not possible. Somebody is going to incur a cost uh so there's gonna be a debt and a credit somewhere. Alright, so with that approach, I understand that years ago I have not looked into solar for a minute, but years ago, you know, and there's still a lot of companies that are offering, hey, we, we put in free solar, but they're not, they are, they are renting roof space with the intent of ownership or leasing contract agreement, right, so that means that they own the property. Company, so the solar company has the um the right to all of the credits and all of the write-offs, correct? OK, so there I don't know what the depreciation is. Years ago you could write off X amount of depreciation in the first year, so whatever money you incurred, uh, upfront. Material and labor, you will get a large percentage of that back throughout the first year and however many years you can write that off plus you get the credits that you can sell on the market. OK, so somebody got paid, which was the solar company. The the owner may have gotten a reduction in a bill. But the better value of the trade-off was not to the owner, it was to the people that had the strategy for the roof, so I understand that concept. So I just wanna make sure that, you know, in my we on the same page in terms of where the value is in the exchange. So alright, so tell me a little bit about who you guys are, what you do, and you told me I can get free solar and free electricity. That's what you said. Alright, so yeah, I'd like to hear that.
Speaker 2:
Amazing, yeah, and, uh, sample you, uh, if you've never heard of us, we're, so we're not really a solar company. We're like an advocacy group and we're actually partnered with 80% of the installers here in DC. So, uh, we started like 2019, and our goal was just to make it really easy and rewarding to Help people do anything sustainable from solar to other sustainability products and services for your home, uh, but solar is what we mostly do. And after doing like 1600 of these installs, we've pretty much figured out like who are the good insulers, you know, who to avoid. There's like there's like 60 of them here, and most of our projects go through Solar Solution or ROI construction
Speaker 1:
and who are they? Are they project managers or they're installers, OK.
Speaker 2:
And they have their own like project management and stuff like that. It's our role in the process to get this to the roof and make sure you have a really easy experience and make sure it goes off without a hitch, and it's always better to have more representation in this process, especially if you're more interested in getting those. Credits and doing more of the investment option because what we do is we bring like you know 60 or 70 installs to these installers a month and it's like a group discount so we'll do bundle installs and you get way more leverage than if you go directly to any of the installers.
Speaker 1:
OK, so you guys do your own pre-marketing. You bring the qualified client to the table. OK. All right, um, I'm just curious, so what other than that, are you guys just playing a role for the, for the marketing and the And bring the qualified client to the table. What else are you involved in?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, that would be like our main role for the installer is like we're, uh, we're bringing them volume and like that's how we make money. Like we get paid on like it's cheaper for them to pay us to bring them like 60 installs a month than for them to spend the advertising dollars.
Speaker 1:
I got you I got you. OK, alright, OK, that makes sense. So, um, I understand. Alright, so let's talk about um. Let's talk about costs. What, what are we looking at here? Yeah, for you guys? Yeah, for this unit here.
Speaker 2:
Got you. There's, so there's two ways to do it. There's the free solar that Martin talked to you about, the, the, the free solar, yeah, that's option one, and that's what most people do. And option two is, uh, like a purchase. So like you could pay cash or you could take a financing for it. There, there is a cost to that one. Mhm. And for that one, that's where you own all the incentives. So like there's the tax credit, there's like uh a monthly check that you would get direct deposited to your bank account for those credits that you're selling, and it's pretty lucrative. Like if you can swing it, I'd say do it, and you seem like a smart guy like you're like running this whole building here. And if you're in a position to do it, I'd say do it because those credits, they, they've never been higher.
Speaker 1:
OK, so, um, let's, let's look at both options. All right, um, now on the reo, OK, so if If we were to look at the free solar, all right, what is the cost associated with that once it's installed?
Speaker 2:
So for the free solar program, we will never ask you for payment information. What happens is you, you get a fixed zero cent electric rate, so you're, you're buying all of the power for 0 cents. The way we set it up, you're, you're right. Like other companies, they'll they'll take more than they need. They'll like, you know, own your whole roof space and have all the rights to your roof space. With this one, the way you set it up, you're not like, uh, signing away like owning a roof like they are gonna use the space up there to, to put the panels, but it's not like they own your, your roof, but they do own the, they do own the credits so that like that's how they make their money back. The reason they would pay, yeah, the reason they would pay so much money to Put it on your house for no cost, like do it for free. They're gonna make all their money back in like 4 years and then keep profiting after that. So they're playing the long game, but you can, you can do that too. And that's why the investment option is pretty cool if you can swing it. And but with the free program, there, there would absolutely be no cost ever unless you know, you get up on the roof and start smashing it with a hammer. They're, uh, they're making the money off of it, so they take full responsibility for, for everything.
Speaker 1:
OK, so there would be, uh, what is the life expectancy of the that program because solar has a life expectancy what about 20 years or is it more now?
Speaker 2:
It's more now. The warranty that you would get, uh, either program is the 30 year production is about 90% output on year 30 as it is on year one. So it'll degrade 10% or so in 30 years, which means like it, it might be up there for like 40 or 50 years. Uh, at 30 years from now though, they'll have like, you know, large scale utility solar like the whole grid will be, you know, like electrified. There's probably gonna be something better at it, but it's not something that, you know, you're gonna have to put on your roof and then like take off and replace in like 1020 years from now. It'll be up there for a while,
Speaker 1:
yeah. OK, so with that lease program, uh, lease is about 30 years. There is 0. Cost for electricity, OK. All right.
Speaker 2:
The other cool thing too is you, you own all, even though you're not paying for it, you have rights to the power. So, for example, if you send more power to the grid than you need, PEPCO has to pay you back for it. Even though you didn't pay for the system, you want all the power, so not only are you getting it at a zero cent rate, any excess that you send to them, it'll be tracked on your PEPCO bill, and then they'll pay it out to you if there's excess at the end of each year.
Speaker 1:
OK, so that goes to the owner and not the solar, uh, installer,
Speaker 2:
correct? You, you just get a check, uh, in December with your last pet statement.
Speaker 1:
OK, so that's a uh annual check based on year ending overages. OK.
Speaker 2:
And that's if you overproduce. I do bring that up cause it's a fairly large system, so you, it's more than likely you'd be in that category. And that's where, uh, if you, if we look at like your electric usage enough, you know, we can kind of figure that out for you, but I'll show you this because this, this stuff would be the same for uh either way you do it.
Speaker 1:
OK. All right, before we get into maybe this, let me just go over, um, option B. Option B meaning that we come in and we want to Uh, on the system and we, you know, hire or with I guess you guys assistance since you guys help facilitate the, um, uh, the match up with installers and owner so if we wanted to look at that option then what would we be looking at cost wise and then what's the advantage of that uh as relates to um. The they do they still call them Srex? OK, so the Srex coming back to us and is there a cap on how much we can produce. No, so if we wanted to maximize every square foot of our roof space that is going to exceed whatever our um kilowatt consumption is on a monthly basis. We can max it out. Yeah, OK, so everything that is above what we normally use, that's that overage, is that coming back on a monthly basis? How is that all calculated?
Speaker 2:
Yes, the, the monthly basis thing is you'd very more than likely get one each month, but it's like every time you hit 1000 kilowatts of power, they're gonna send you a check for whatever because the SAC is. It's 1000 kilowatts of clean energy produced and then someone will buy that from you. And for every like $1 you put into the system, you're getting like uh more than $1 back. It's like you're putting $1 into the system and then you're getting a buck $50 back in Sres, but it's about, it's about, uh, usually it's about like a 4 year return on investment. Like if you paid cash, you make all your money back in like 4 years. Hm, OK, and I can break down like how the uh like numbers work and everything, but that's like the, yeah, OK, um, that's why people max it out,
Speaker 1:
right, right, yeah, yeah, so we do have a really big group space, right, I'm interested, very, very, very interested in seeing what that looks like. So now, um. OK, let, let me let you go into it because then my next question is dealing with other contractors like I'm never gonna pay retail for anything. I, I just don't, you know, uh, so I guess you guys have the relationships with the ones that are more user friendly as it relates to working with different types of owners. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
OK. And that's where we can like leverage a pretty good deal for you like I mean if you want to go with the like absolute cheapest option like. There's like definitely some like kind of sketchy installers that like just do it super cheap. You can definitely get like a really good uh like market rate and like hey if you do find someone that's like they they'll price match it for you,
Speaker 1:
OK, because I'm an electrical contractor too licensed here in the DC area, so um there's probably a lot that I can do. I mean, I've never installed solar before but it's really just following a set of schematics, making sure that you have the right support systems. I mean it's nothing difficult. It's I'm a commercial electrician. Oh,
Speaker 2:
you're probably like overqualified.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I, I'm pretty sure I'd picked these guys apart from an install standpoint. However, um. So let's, what do you, what do you got here, man? OK, so there's a lot of panels, man. You guys really just went in and did something here. OK, talk to me. Interesting.
Speaker 2:
So this is, this is like the max that you could do pretty much. Maybe you could add like an extra 1 or 2, but this is yeah.
Speaker 1:
I bring in the expert here. Uh, we took a look at your roof here and we're like, Whoa, this is massive. And I was like, Paul, check this out, and, uh, he came over here and, uh, built this massive thing. So I wanna see what's going on. Yeah, so wait, what is this so all of this is in. Go
Speaker 2:
there,
Speaker 1:
which is all in levels so that's hard.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, which really helps with your production cause like there's really not a lot of shade and uh utilizing the parapet walls gets you a little bit more room. All in all, though, if you, if you max out the roof, this system, whether you do the free one or purchase it, it's gonna produce uh over 21,000 kilowatt hours of energy.
Speaker 1:
Is that annually?
Speaker 2:
Yes,
Speaker 1:
OK.
Speaker 2:
And the value of that power is it's about 16 cents a kilowatt hour is almost $3500. So if you did, for example, if you did the free program, you'd pay nothing and then this would be saving you $3500 power a year, which I doubt you're using that much. So it's like, hey, if you use only $2000 worth of power, then that extra $1500. They'll pay you back the difference. It's a it's a slightly lower rate, but they'll pay you back the difference for you at the end of the year. So it's like, hey, not only are you saving everything on the electric, but you're getting a significant check at the end of the year.
Speaker 1:
OK, so these checks are only on an annual basis. They're
Speaker 2:
not for the free program, yeah,
Speaker 1:
OK, but if I wanted to buy the system and do it myself, uh, or, or have ownership,
Speaker 2:
yeah,
Speaker 1:
then what are we looking at?
Speaker 2:
Right on. Let me plug this in to have like a spreadsheet that breaks it down. It's by system size.
Speaker 1:
And how many panels is that total?
Speaker 2:
That's 45.
Speaker 1:
OK.
Speaker 2:
Average, average system for contacts like average system size is maybe more around like 9 or 10 kilowatts, and this is 18, which makes sense cause it's like double the normal roof size. mhm. But let me clear this one out. Your production is 2. You don't know.
Speaker 1:
You know, I've always wanted to do a solar job. and this might be my first one. I'm up for a challenge, man. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
you'll, you'll probably have some good combos with the like uh people and stuff like, uh, you'll know more than I do when they're talking to me about stuff. OK. Total cost for a system this size, um, to be competitive it'd be around like 54 6 90.
Speaker 1:
OK. Is that based on how do you calculate the industry standard competitive rate for install?
Speaker 2:
It's price per watt, OK, of system size and a lot of them, like if you just like reach out to someone for like a proposal, you'll see a lot of like Like 333.3 price per per per watt or maybe like lower. This is at $3 price per watt which I'm pretty confident we could get this done at and Uh, yeah, if you could find something better, then like, yeah, go for it.
Speaker 1:
OK, so average about 3, that's a really competitive price, $3 for what, correct? All right, so that's material labor
Speaker 2:
cost.
Speaker 1:
Got you. OK. All right, um, OK,
Speaker 2:
so like for example if you wrote a check for it. You write a check for like 540. And then two incentives. So the first one is the federal tax credit, which I think we mentioned a little bit. So depending on how much you pay in taxes, you would get about $16,000 back on your taxes,
Speaker 1:
that 30% roughly,
Speaker 2:
yeah, mhm.
Speaker 1:
OK, sure, yeah.
Speaker 2:
And then, what is more lucrative is the money that you'd be getting paid for all the power that you're sending to the grid. Mhm. So, I know there's a lot of numbers here, uh, but like I mentioned, either way, you're gonna get the bill savings, so it's like $3000 400 dollars a year, uh, power goes up in value, so it's like you'll be saving more and more each year. But the this column is the column that you get with the incentives. So those SAts. Because this is sending so much power to the grid, it does go down over time,
Speaker 1:
but it's based on system performance most likely it's gonna perform the most in the beginning and it decreases as it goes down. Would that be correct? Um,
Speaker 2:
you're on the right track. It's like a, it's like a 1%. Degradation in year one and the grades a little bit faster for the first year and then it's like less than that after that. The thing, the SE values go down over time because as they get more solar on the grid as more of these credits are being produced, they become less valuable. So it's just supply and demand. You're you're locked in for the 1st 3 years, so it's those numbers for the 1st 3 years are guaranteed. So even, you know, hey, if something weird passes and they go down, you know, you'll be guaranteed to get that and then it brings you pretty close to your ROI cause like year 4. You know, year before your cash cash flow is like $63,000 so you'll, if you like, you'll get all your money back in like 4 years.
Speaker 1:
OK, so my, my question for you would be, that's, that's annual, that 8898, that's annual. OK. So does that mean that we get a check back every month for roughly just for the sake of our conversation, $741? You divide that 8898 by 12. On average, yes. OK, so then we are not paying any at that point, we are really Um, This becomes a performing asset from the utility side of things because we're not, we are we are really generating uh enough electricity to sustain what we are using here that we're paying PEPCO. And then that would be the difference,
Speaker 2:
yeah, is what you're saying. That's why people do it. OK, so the money that you're the money that you're saving on the bill and all the income that you're making from the tracks, you're up like 1011 grand each year for a long time and it's like, yeah, it's kind of crazy, but you know, hey, in 25 years you're in a position where you're like 2500. Uh, richer than if you just stayed with Pepco. Right. So that's, that's why people do this,
Speaker 1:
and that's a performing asset that's like um having a rental with no tenant issues. Exactly, yeah, no complaints, no leaky toilets, no cockroaches,
Speaker 2:
and that's why they'll do it for free too because they're, they're playing the game like the the installer wants to make this money, you
Speaker 1:
know. I like that, man. Yeah man, you might be convincing me to do something additional, uh, OK, so I like this. Um, I'm gonna give you my email address. I am I missing anything? Um, I don't wanna cut you off from your explanation here. So, um, how would this work if, you know, cause I do have to sit down and And deal with my the skepticism of my wife, um, but, um, I see this, please email this to me. So what role would you guys facilitate? And we decide that we do want to move forward. Um, what role would you guys facilitate in the process? What would that be?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, so we would submit your application, like I guess like, uh, like step one to like you getting this and getting paid from it is we submit an application
Speaker 1:
through the application going
Speaker 2:
to it'd be through Solar Solution.
Speaker 1:
Who was that? That's
Speaker 2:
the installer.
Speaker 1:
OK, so. Um, am I locked in to solar solutions to do anything? Why are we going in that direction and what role do they play in this whole process? Are you guys locked into a contract with them that if you, if you secure a client, then you're gonna bring that client to Solar Solutions.
Speaker 2:
Um, no, it's not like that. Like I could, you know, I could put this through another installer, uh, if I, if I wanted to,
Speaker 1:
and, and here's why, why I'm asking is because as soon as you send me this information, I'm, I'm a very transparent person. I'm gonna shop numbers, I, I am because on one hand. I'm a master electrician. Our company has the ability to go and get things at cost. So I'm gonna weigh out, well, how much does the material cost and once I know once I can separate that out of that 54,000. Then I can kind of really gauge what's competitive. Does that make sense? And I, I don't wanna, you know, feel like I'm, you know, kind of undercutting you guys. I'm, I'm not that way, but I'm, I'm looking at that number. So if that number is 54,000. The solar guys either I'm going to bring my own financing to the table or I'm pretty sure they have an option. So if I use their financing, of course, then they've got markup on everything. I mean it's business and I get it. So, um, I am gonna weigh that out, but I like what you guys are doing. This is, this is nice. This is nice. This is causing me to look at this from a different perspective. That's yeah, that, that's awesome. OK,
Speaker 2:
I'm I'm glad. you're able to see some value of it.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, so you guys are, you're from New Mexico. Why are you way up here in Washington, DC? Or
Speaker 2:
actually, I grew up in Ohio, um, but we, we met in New Mexico because I used to work for a solar company out there, and I left that solar company to work with one of my friends who's done this in DC for a lot longer because, uh,
Speaker 1:
who's your friend in DC, uh,
Speaker 2:
Travis Richardson, he's one of the other, uh, consultants at our organization. OK,
Speaker 1:
OK. And
Speaker 2:
out anywhere else in the country, this is your only option and there's none of this. So it's like a 15 year ROI and that's it. You're just getting the tax credit, so like the amount of people that work. We're able to help because it's like 90 95% of the people just do the free one and we're able to help so many more people and have way more impact and I'd rather be helping like 20 or 30 people a month than like 2 to 5
Speaker 1:
so that's why I came out here yeah so this is it because this area has such A high demand and then also the payout on the other side versus other states. This seems to have more appeal.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, oh yeah, and it's all about, I don't know if Martin talked about like the Clean Energy Act that they passed here.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, he was telling me about that and they're way off. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
well, because we have 8 years and we have to, for DC, the mandate is it has to be 100% of our power has to be renewable here. Not only that, the renewable power has to be produced inside the district. They're not, they can't ship it in from like New Jersey or, you know.
Speaker 1:
OK, all right, um. 100% that is a very um lofty. Expectation, um, do they even have the roof capacity to even do that if you look at the rooftops in DC, there's enough roof capacity to create that much alternative energy.
Speaker 2:
Not 100%. Like they're not trying, only 15% has to come from solar. OK, where did you get the
Speaker 1:
100% from? Where did that come from? You just say 100%.
Speaker 2:
So 100% renewable energy, but that includes that includes way more than solar because they're gonna do like wind, geothermal, like other like utility scale solar that they can do as far as like the residential side like rooftop, that has to be 15%, but they're gonna get everything else. I'm like hydro geothermal like stuff that I'm not as like well versed in. I got you.
Speaker 1:
Alright, so they, they, they have a lot of different models that they can look at to, you know, I got you, I got you, OK, um, alright, um, do you guys do strictly when you look at the whole, uh, alternative energy model as a pie, right? So How much of this pie solar?
Speaker 2:
I think right now it's like 5%,
Speaker 1:
and that's all they care about here in the district is 5%.
Speaker 2:
What do you mean, uh, what
Speaker 1:
they care about alternative energy production from solar, so this is a pie. So some of this could come in just really well if it's, it's, it's gonna be alternative energy sources, I don't know, they're not gonna do no, uh, I don't know where they're gonna come up with the rest of it. Geothermal, that's a lot to dig in the ground in DC. This DC is on is swamp land, so what. What's the rest of it look like? But then again, I don't really care about that because I mean that's outside of my model as an electrical contractor.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, and it's, it's it's a little outside my expertise too,
Speaker 1:
let's lane. OK, let's
Speaker 2:
lane but there is like a pie like that where you know certain amounts come from different sources, right,
Speaker 1:
right, yeah, yeah, so, uh, OK, um, so. Solar, how much, how much of this demand have they satisfied in DC?
Speaker 2:
That, so that's where
Speaker 1:
And do you guys do commercial or just residential? You do commercial as well? Are you guys plugged into any of the uh contracts through DC's office, uh, DOE? There it is right there, isn't it? Yeah, sustainable office of DC. Are you guys connected to their programs and uh contracts at all?
Speaker 2:
I would say. Well, I, I guess like how
Speaker 1:
on commercial side,
Speaker 2:
on the commercial side, it works all the same as residential. So the connection with like the DOE to the way these things are happening is that the DOE sets the mandate and then like PEPCO and the trade for the SRX have to follow like. Mandates. So it's not like we're like talking with the DOE. The the DOE actually they're not allowed to like it'd be a monopoly if they were like, hey, you have to go like this is the solar company you should go with.
Speaker 1:
That's
Speaker 2:
where all the money comes from
Speaker 1:
though. I get you on that, but they also have their. Um, their incentives or their goals that you guys, all of the, the third party contractors are helping them to meet their overall goals, so that's on commercial buildings, residential buildings, so, uh, I don't know if you guys are tied because they're awarding contracts as well to companies based on rooftops in DC. I used to pull permits probably about 8 years ago for a company that was putting Solar on top of schools and they needed, you know, they were from another state and they needed somebody to pull permits and I was pretty impressed with what I saw what they were doing, um, so I was just wondering if you guys were tied into the commercial side. Of the opportunities as well,
Speaker 2:
yeah, we, that's like the whole other side of our business. We do commercial and it, it would just be set up the same way as this like if someone wants to purchase a, a commercial system like if or if you have like an LLC you want to like purchase this way. Instead of like you, you're like you as a person, then like the LLC would get the tax credit and like you get all the checks for that. It doesn't matter if it's like a business buying it or a person buying it, it all works the same yeah so there isn't like extra um. Like set up or partnerships that have to be in place, it's just like, hey, is a person buying it or is the business buying it? Cool, it's a business. It's you get all the same incentives.
Speaker 1:
I got you, yeah.
Speaker 2:
And I'm looking to. Um, so this is the sustainable DC 2.0 plan. It's like a very long, uh, document that goes into, like, how they're going to hit this target. I'm trying to find because it like very specifically says Uh, where we're at,
Speaker 1:
can you email that to me as well? Oh
Speaker 2:
yeah, that's.
Speaker 1:
So, um, Based on demand. How much supply. Is in the industry to fulfill the demand and is there a backlog of more demand for installs? They're already queued up ready to go, but over here your, your demand of qualified human resources is not keeping up with this. What does that look like since you guys are kind of like, you guys are really boots on the ground and in the field as well. So do you guys just like you close a deal and hey, here you go, I'm gone. And you guys don't have anything else to do with whoever that client is, or are you guys kind of from conception to completion? That's one of my, don't steal that, that's my second for my company, conception to completion. Do you guys work from beginning to end? Yeah,
Speaker 2:
so not only, not only that, were your representative in this process, not only before the installation happens, but for the lifetime of the system.
Speaker 1:
Hm. What would the other. Scope of work items be after it's installed. What, what else would you guys be doing?
Speaker 2:
Hopefully not much, but that's where, um, I don't promise everyone like, obviously there's like a 30 year warranty on
Speaker 1:
tracking everything electronically.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, and you have full access to that too. So that's like, hey, if, um, you know, I don't promise anyone like, hey, in 30 years like nothing's ever gonna go wrong like you working like you know that like let's say your inverter goes out at like year 6, you know, you'll probably get notified in your app and then we'll get notified too, but. We'll be calling you up and saying, hey Derek, we know your inverter went out. Can we come out on like next Friday to swap it out for you? And then it's DJ that I like that.
Speaker 1:
That's your company. That's you guys' company that does that. Yeah, so you have a built in maintenance. Tracking model. Yes, I like that. All right, um. My other question, OK. Um, so, demand. Let's, what does that look like? You have. Your installers versus the number of installs, what is that ratio look like?
Speaker 2:
I'm trying to find the document, cause there is one document I had that gives a little more. Insight to that, but. The What I know from the top of my head, so the reason why uh they will pay you, uh, essentially it's, it's PEPCO paying you. The reason why PEPCO would pay you. $408 for every 1000 kilowatts of clean power that you produce
Speaker 1:
is because on your grid because it's already over
Speaker 2:
that and not only that, for every 1000 kilowatt hours of like dirty energy they produce, they have to pay $480. So every time they pay you $408 it saves them from having to pay a larger fine,
Speaker 1:
yeah. And then plus the, the overall grid in DC has always been undersized always, so that's the other incentive. So that keeps them from having to because they're doing a lot, they're trying to take all overhead, uh, services underground throughout the whole DC area, and they got a lot on their plate. So, OK, so how about your installers? I mean how much more demand are you? Uh, is, is how much is the need? For qualified installers over here versus at the rate that you guys are putting this out, I can imagine. Everybody that sits down is gonna say yes pretty much you gotta have a very high percentage rate of success, so that means you're closing more deals, so you are stacking up work orders for installs. So how are the installers keeping up? Is there more, it seems like there's more demand for installs than there is people that can do the install.
Speaker 2:
So
Speaker 1:
it,
Speaker 2:
it's actually flip flopped and that's what we're working with and yeah, and that's where we're working with an organization like ours is really beneficial and I'll give you an example. So one of our other really good instalers, ROI Construction, I like using them because we have a little bit more insight into their projects, and they've also done roofing for 49 years, so they have like really good expertise with that. But they can only handle maybe like 40-45 installs a month and they're like at capacity. So like I wouldn't feel good putting someone through them right now because like, hey, you might not get installed till like April solar solution they're they've been around for 17 years doing solar. They have the largest capacity. It's, it's not in. Infinite, but like they're, they could be doing double what they're doing right now. And that's why we put a lot of our jobs through them right now because they're extremely reliable. They've done it for 17 years. They have, they have 6000 projects. The next highest one is like companies like ours that have like between 1500 to 2000, and there's only a handful of those, so they're like killing. Everyone because they've been just doing it for so long. So we put a lot of our project, most of our projects through them and then when the other installer has room, then we put it through them. But if you just went to RI construction and like that was your only option, then it's like, hey, you're getting installed and you know, maybe next summer, you know, that's it. That's where we have the ability we've already done. All of the uh leveraging to get really good prices and make sure that we're getting like really good contractors on this that you can trust are gonna do a good job like, yes, do all your due diligence please please but um we've done a lot of this stuff so we can have confidence that we're giving you a really good product at a if you're buying it at a really good price and, uh, yeah, there isn't like, uh, the only time you get into like. Supply and demand issues with like, hey, all these people want to go solar and then the installer can't handle it. It's like when some of the installers get maxed out but we have 80% of the installers that we can in DC that we can work through. So there's always room for us to help more people.
Speaker 1:
So, uh, it, it sounds like there is um a lot of potential opportunity for somebody to take a look at uh the market entry space. To do the installs.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, a lot of, a lot of companies try to get into it, um, like, for, for example, that other installer, they're, uh, they're newer installer. We really helped to build out their installation department, and they, they've only been around for like 2 or 3 years, and they, in my opinion, they do some of the best work, but they have a lot less volume and sometimes it takes longer and You know, it's, it's like, you know, a balancing thing with different installers, but
Speaker 1:
so would the companies that are looking at the market entry point, are they primarily it sound I've heard you say roofing contractors, so somebody that has a general construction model, um, kind of fits the, the footprint, so to speak, would that be a fair assessment? OK, so somebody with a with an electrical installation background. Would probably even be a better fit in that footprint, yeah,
Speaker 2:
maybe because they'd already have all the understanding on those things. OK,
Speaker 1:
so here's where I'm going is that um I like this and I like this a lot and um I'm looking at how we might be able to carve out some opportunity and how we can actually work together. Yeah, with our company, so our company is Turnkey Solutions. OK, we are a general and the electrical contracting company. Where, how many states are you guys in? How many states are you guys in? Uh, we're just primarily we're headquartered here and, uh, yeah, and in Dallas, uh, we, we've done just new construction in Dallas. Yeah, because I've been here 3 days now and I've heard of Turkey solutions before. I don't know how, but that's it's, it's some it's, it's another Turkey, so we're, we're probably the smaller side of that, that conversation. I'm pretty sure that. So and and here's the reason that I that I say that is um. You know, we did this whole project. Our company, we totally gutted this house so we have a really good footprint and relationships from uh anything pertaining to everything framing, plumbing, you name it. We have a good relationship and then we also are electrical. So I would love to, you know, to let this maybe be um a project that we can take a look at doing. Uh, we have. Um, over 35 years of experience in the electrical, and that's primarily through, uh, my experience. I'm a master electrician here in District of Columbia. As well as the state of Texas as well, um, and I'm interested in looking at, you know, um, kind of another business model that's a niche model, you know, uh, and I think this may be, this may be a good fit.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, or, or maybe that, uh, let me, let me know if I'm way off with this or not, um. If you set up, if you set up like a whole installation department or something that will like install solar systems like great incentives are gonna go down like the pre-solar probably not gonna be around another year or two from now and like 8 years like that's probably when it, you know, stops being a good deal. What you can do instead of like setting up a whole like solar installation company and then like 8 years from now like it not really being profitable anymore, you can invest in the projects so you can like be. the purchaser of these systems, so it's like you would just fund someone's project, so another installer can, can do it that already has the operation set up and then you just collect your checks from the thing and then 8 years from now when you know the incentives are, aren't gonna be around anymore like to make it like such a good deal then like there's a lot of insulers that are gonna go out of business and uh
Speaker 1:
but.
Speaker 2:
If you're just investing in it, you're, it's the least like liability,
Speaker 1:
right, right,
Speaker 2:
that could be
Speaker 1:
that I look at anything that makes financial sense. Yeah, I, I look at both sides of the coin, so I would be interested in looking at both of them, uh, and then I also have um. A good friend that owns a solar company. Oh, you know which one, Give me one second. He's in Dallas, uh, but they do a lot of large. Uh, what do you call them, um. Mega, megawatt, mega yeah. And uh let me see, I can tell you the name of your company. He's in Dallas primarily, but he wanted me to, uh, partner with them because they don't have a master electrician record. And uh I was gonna definitely hang my license. What is the name of his company? Wait a sec. Very quickly, I'm, I'm sort of on this sort of on the same path that you're doing here back home in Michigan, you know, I built a couple of houses, uh, and, um, my plan was in the next like 4 years, uh, you meet with electrician, start to get my, you know, my license just because, um, the, the house building, you know, like side of it is not too difficult. If you're a smart guy and you can work together with other people. There's a lot of ways you can, you know, make things a lot more efficient and, uh, you know. Things a lot more quickly, uh, but then, you know, I started talking to Paul about what's going on here and it's like this isn't gonna last forever. So, uh, I, and also, you know, winter is coming in Michigan, so I like hit the brakes on construction and uh I came out here. My plan is to keep doing the free solar stuff, uh, here in DC, um, until, you know, either gets back warm or it ends and you go back to it's, um, I mean the work you guys are doing here is great. Thank you, yeah, I, yeah. I like injection a lot. Troop energy. Trooping. I haven't heard them. Yeah, they, they are, um. Um, The core of the company is actually from Mexico, and they have, uh, their primary business model has always been to do solar farms, so they've got, you know, massive experience and that's one of their business models, so they, they, they still do that, so they took. The expertise and they bought it into the United States. They have a headquarters in Dallas. They just rolled this out probably going on 2 years now, so they have a residential arm and they have the commercial arm where they're doing the solar farms, uh, so you know, um, you know, again what I wanted to do and plus we do, we do, um. I'll show this to you guys as well since we're having a conversation. Um, We do New construction projects and what I wanted to do. As a builder, so this is, uh, that's our project that we just completed in Dallas last year and, and I wanted to do solar on those um duplexes. And the issue that I had was People that are in this industry are just either totally sales-driven and they don't hear you. Um, and it was hard to get somebody on the phone, man. Like, really, how do I talk to somebody about a project? Like don't, that's why I told you what I said, please don't come in here with a sales pitch because it's gonna turn me off and it's just not gonna work. Oh man. So by me being on the real estate, you know, and I, I lean more on the real estate development side because that's where I make. The most of my money. I don't really make money as a contractor, you know, there's only so much markup you can put on on a project. So, um, but what I wanted to be able to do is to do exactly what you we're talking about like those roofs are designed. They were perfectly designed for solar, and there's no trees in the way and. I wanted to just put solar on, on the roofs, leave that as the incentive to the owner. I was only gonna take ownership of the first year, and then after, you know, they were sold. Hey, you know, I turned everything over to the, OK, uh, so look at the roots. Yeah those are great. Yeah, so we, we, we, we, it's uh it's 5 duplexes wow. Yes, 5 duplexes, um. Uh, yes, the roof space, but anyway, I can uh send that to my guy here. So, um, you know, I, I had a conversation with Augustine. The guy that owns the company and they've got some really good inroads for the purchasing of the panels because they are, you know, a full bona fide solar company. Uh, for, you know, material and labor installation. So, you know, to, to my point is like, hey, if there's a way to carve out a space and it makes sense, I'm definitely interested, I'm definitely interested in both sides, so I would definitely be looking towards what he could actually help do. Um, with this, and I need to know what you guys' expectations are financially, if we could just be as very, as transparent as possible because I'm not gonna say that that number $3 per watt is the best deal cause I'm gonna be looking at it if I have to, if I, if my first project has to be my own property. Then I'd like to be hands-on to see exactly what the expectations are and to see where I can add value because I'm a commercial electrician, so I look at things totally different than your average installer that never Doesn't know anything about the electrical side of things, stabilization, mounting, or any of that. I'm like, I'm pretty sure I could probably come up with some things that people have never seen.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, and I, I think I, I think you should really talk to that, uh, guy Travis that I mentioned because he is, uh, more on the commercial side and he's also invested in some projects personally
Speaker 1:
and you want me to send you this video? Uh yes.
Speaker 2:
Um, And he would, I think he would be able to answer like, uh, see like what opportunities could be available on that side as far as the residential goes, like these projects are extremely easy and they've done, you know, a million of them. They do the it's less than a day they finish the project, so that that's all I got say you're probably way overqualified for the residential stuff, but for the commercial stuff that's way more complex,
Speaker 1:
right? Well, I mean, because here's the thing if Even on the residential side, sometimes saving. An hour is always based on what application you're looking at, you know, for installation. So, um, you know, I don't know. I, I, I mean, I'm, I'm very, very interested. This is really picking my attention. So what's our next steps here?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, um, I'm definitely gonna send you an email with some of this information like the design and kind of like how the
Speaker 1:
my email, uh, please, yeah. OK.
Speaker 2:
And I know that uh I know you said you, you wanna make sure your, your wife's cool with it and everything, um, definitely gotta make sure that first, um, but if like somewhere down the road you guys are like, hey, this, this looks great, you know, uh, let's like, you know, move forward. The, your next steps on that, which like, don't do that today, um, because you guys start to reverse, uh, we would submit the purchase application and if you're gonna pay with cash or like Check or something. Nothing's due till install day and they would just send you an invoice after the work's done. Or if you did financing, you would apply for financing, uh, after you sign up, and then the payments would start after it's, uh, put on the roof. Uh, we do, we would want to make sure you like feel good about the project before you move forward. Um, but once you send an application, then we'll come out, we'll do an inspection on the roof, and everything's like pretty new. Like it'll pass. It'll be good.
Speaker 1:
Well, what happens if I don't want to use them at all and I just want to do, do this through my own company? Then how does that change the dynamics of what you guys set in place because and then then it would be in a matter of Um, are, is there any violation of any contractual obligation that you guys already have with these other companies or are you operating totally independent, um, and there is no, no violation? Um,
Speaker 2:
what we couldn't do is like if we submit your application with the, uh, one installer, what we couldn't do is like start the project with one company and then switch it to another.
Speaker 1:
I mean we wouldn't even be submitting any applications so then you guys would have to get compensated because you are bringing. The opportunities to me and I'd still like for you guys to continue to do exactly what you said you do so um whatever your compensation is in this whole um scope of work, uh, I'd like to know what that is so we can put that on the table, but I will tell you 9 times out of 10, I'm not saying that I won't. But I am really looking at. How I can utilize our company to to do this. Yeah, is that gonna be a problem? Uh,
Speaker 2:
I will say this. It took the, the newer installer mentioned, it took them two years to get to the point where they could reliably install. So if you're talking about like you actually doing the work on the home, it, you wouldn't get this project would never happen, this wouldn't happen because if it wouldn't happen, it'd take you like maybe 2 years to get to the point where you could actually install everything and then what do you
Speaker 1:
mean 2 years based on what?
Speaker 2:
Based on like how long it takes to uh get like uh there's like cer I don't know like everything on all the certifications you have to have to have these set up but this there's a lot more red tape than a lot of usual construction projects because you're not only like working with the city like yes we're working with the you gotta to submit like a DOB application. But you're we're also have to get everything approved by PEPCO and you have to have everything right like stickers need to be in the right place. The zip tie needs to be a certain color and it's like very, they're very anal about everything because it has to be
Speaker 1:
perfect. I don't think you really understand like that if it if it has to do with installation and qualification. I, I'm pretty sure we can do that now if it has to do with, I think at some point, um, there has to be someone that has a certain type of license. I, I don't know what that is, but I do believe that, uh, on the solar side there is, uh, someone has to have a certain type of license in order for the system to be commissioned. Yeah, they, they,
Speaker 2:
they, they have their own master electricians and stuff that they certify everything. And then that's the purpose of the when we submit an application to the DMV for the permits, they're gonna check everything, we'll send them like in. We work with an engineering firm. They come up with like, uh, a drawing and like a huge document like this, like, hey, this is exactly what we're gonna put on this person's roof. And then the uh PEPCO has to approve everything, and then the DOB has to approve everything, uh, the engineering uh department has to approve everything, and then, uh, after we submit all the electrical stuff and everything, get all the approvals, then you're, you're ready to install.
Speaker 1:
So what if I bring all that to the table? They.
Speaker 2:
Well, that's the thing. I don't know if since they like the installer we would go through, they already have all their own people. So if they like swap out like let's say you want to be the master electrician for a job that like your own project, well they already have their own guy. If they take that guy off the project then like. What, like what's in it for them to take their guy off the project and then pay you?
Speaker 1:
I don't, I don't, I don't think we're we're looking at this from the same page, so it sounds like that. You guys already have your system baked in
Speaker 2:
for audiences, yes, OK,
Speaker 1:
you already have it baked in so it would not be advantageous for me to look at doing this outside of what you all already have in place.
Speaker 2:
That'd be up to the installer, and that's where like I think it, it'd be worth the conversation, um, with my colleague Travis to see like where you could provide value. But I, I have had that happen before because the last time I tried to do this, there was, uh, he was also an electrician and he, his thing was he would only do solar if it was like with like union-backed, um, like workers, uh, doing the work on his home. That was his thing. He loved solar but. If it's like a union because he, he was like a union electrical worker.
Speaker 1:
I'm also a graduate from 26, but I don't think that way OK
Speaker 2:
got you
Speaker 1:
yeah I understand.
Speaker 2:
OK, and it was, uh, it was a whole household. They wouldn't do it because like they they like there was like no reason for the installer to that that what you're working against is this is something that a ton of people are doing. It's like really easy for them to like. You know, set a ton of these up for people, and that's why there's so many of these going in and like. Even if you're the the best like electrician in DC like they already have people like in place and it's like, even to like on like, you know, the, the pricing like they do like I, I don't know exactly what it is, but like they, I'm sure like they probably make a good chunk of change on it um but it's like, hey, if you like they're not worried about losing uh business cause like I mean that's why I don't have like a I don't like try super hard with people because like there's there's so many people that are just like sign up and want to sign up. So like everyone has their own timing and tolerance though. So it's like, I mean, hey, if you can get out of it, will you want to get out of it? Yeah, go for it. Like if you like, like how long it, you know, takes you to feel good about it, like, awesome, cool, we'll. We'll help you any way we can to get you what you need and yeah,
Speaker 1:
OK, alright, I'll tell you what, um, I've sent you my email address, uh, so let's, let's move the ball down the court and in the meantime I'm gonna make phone calls with, um, with my colleagues because I think that by the time I, I look into the resources that I do have access to. That we may have all of the necessary players in place to get it done and then I would love to be able to if we do, then that's great. If, if the path of leech resistance is for me to just, you know, look at making sure that we can bring the finance into the table and that's the path of leech resistance, then that's not a problem. I'll put that on the table as well. Um, but if there is an opportunity that we already have all of the players in place and it's just a matter of making phone calls and going through the protocol and we can still get it done in the same amount of time that we would if we just said, hey, let me use your contractor then we'll We'll put that on the table. I don't, and I like you all's model. Who's the owner? Are you the owner? Who's the owner of your organization here.
Speaker 2:
The owner is Marcus Hoy.
Speaker 1:
I like, um, I like what they're doing.
Speaker 2:
So this is Marcus, he, um, and that's where we're more of a solar company too. He used to work for Tesla and like, yes, we wanna help people go solar. That's our main business because it's so freaking easy in DC and either it's free or you get paid a bunch of money to do it. But we, our mission, uh, goes like way beyond DC like secretly we wanna like, I don't know, like help people like help some. not just get solar but get an electric vehicle and like sign up for all these like uh sustainable uh services that we provide. We have all these partnerships and we want to create like a world where everyone's conscious about how we're impacting the environment and that's like his like life's mission and it's like it's really inspiring,
Speaker 1:
but it's funny that you mentioned that because on my units that I did I put in. Uh, an, an additional outlet specifically for EV charging just in every house in the garage there was a 40 a two-pole circuit there, just in the wall with a blank cover plate. All they had to do was just if they were gonna buy a vehicle, just look at the configuration for the the female connector and install it. So, uh, I, I like that. I like that, uh, I like that a lot, um, yeah, definitely, definitely, so, um. I don't know, there, there may be some, some, some additional opportunities, man, because we've looked at installing even charging stations. I've, I've looked at that opportunity. It's just a lot of things that I've looked into. I have anything related to alternative energy, I'm always very interested in what that looks like. Right on, uh, for sure. What is that website again?
Speaker 2:
Um, it's sustainableu.org. I can send a link to everything in the email too um but I'll definitely have a conversation with my friend Travis since he's more uh involved on some of those things you mentioned. Um, I'll have a conversation with him and uh see if it makes sense to set up a call with you to go over like, uh, how we can help each other out, and I'll send an email uh with that spreadsheet of the breakdown and the that like sustainable DC 2.0 plan. And is there anything else in the design as well? Is there anything else you think would be helpful if I send it over to you?
Speaker 1:
Um, no, not, not necessarily at this stage. I think you hit all of the, the, the, um, important concerns for me price. And it definitely the um. Um, The performance, what can be made on this is, uh, uh, that's very impressive, very
Speaker 2:
impressive.
Speaker 1:
It's a, it's
Speaker 2:
a great system like the efficiency is like. We are usually looking for. This may not mean a ton, but we're usually looking for at least 900 kilowatt hours per kilowatt of system size, and this is like 1200, which is like, that's 1200 to 1300 is like, that's like top end of efficiency for systems.
Speaker 1:
So. And do you guys do DC or you do the whole DMV area? We do the whole country, OK, but I mean your model is your model just DC or you also doing the same thing for Maryland and Virginia, um.
Speaker 2:
Uh, no, same thing, we, so like a lot of the insular partners we have, we have partners that like if you were in Maryland, we would probably put it through like Nova or Green Brilliance and then uh same thing for Virginia. They, you can't do the free program there, but we would do work with the local local programs there and we do most of our business in DMV. Um, specifically DC, but we have plenty of installs that go in in Virginia and Maryland, and then we have national installers that we're partnered to. So as long as you're not in like Alaska, we can help you out. I mean,
Speaker 1:
we, my wife and I just uh cut down this massive, massive oak tree that was in our backyard.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah. Was it?
Speaker 1:
not here. It's uh oh another 10 yeah, yeah, this is, uh, can you pull up another property from there here in Maryland.
Speaker 2:
Oh, not in here, no. It like cuts off.
Speaker 1:
So I was just wondering about the. That might be the the second location as well. OK, well, guys, I have, uh, uh, gotten everything that I need. If you can send that over to me SAP. I can take a look at that. In more detail and please um. Speak with your colleague and let me know. Uh, what We can do in terms of having a conversation. About opportunities.
Speaker 2:
Right on. Let me, I'll do that email right now before. I get going like to that spreadsheet. All right. And Mara, could you please text me the email?
Speaker 1:
I can give it to you if you want, just key it in. Oh, OK. Was it D E R R I C K? At Howard Holdings. LLC.com. Cool Waste so. Yeah
Speaker 2:
And you have a car, uh, business card?
Speaker 1:
No, I don't do business cards anymore.
Speaker 2:
No worries. And I got this
Speaker 1:
Like
Speaker 2:
that To our website.
Speaker 1:
Can you check this
Speaker 2:
out?
Speaker 1:
Ford Foundation. It's going up. And I'll show you. It's finished. At least on the outside. 52 by 28 ft long, two stories walk out basement. There's our T111 we did siding on this one. Yeah. And that's in, uh, Michigan. Yes sir. Wow, OK. How long does it take to get permits in Michigan? That was quick. I mean, yeah, I mean, actually 4 to 6 weeks. Oh, that's excellent. That's not bad, but you know, you know what, 4 guys, uh, we did this in 7 weeks. 2 of the guys are well above their, you know, above 65 years old, and then there's me and then my friend who was there like. Less than half the time. It's really 3 of us, you know, 3.5 of us, you know, did this in about 7 weeks to this point here. Yes sir. Wow, that's that's pretty good. And this is my first time, you know, building a whole house and, you know, on the ground up. I'll tell you what, most of the time, most couple of those weeks we're just doing like uh. Like, you know, the basements, you know, digging, you know, earthwork, earth moving. The next house we're gonna build is gonna be in a crawl space. So none of that's, uh, and it's no garage, uh, it's gonna be, you know, 28 by 28, 2 stories, um, and our goal is, you know, obviously this is a lofty goal, but, uh, start, finish a house in one month, finish, finish. Yes, what does that sell for? This out there will probably sell for around 4. That's pretty good. What are the lots cost? Uh, we already owned it. Uh, you can't really ask me how much it costs to build this because we already owned a lot of the materials and you already own the land and all the equipment and everything, so it's really hard to say how much it costs, but it's really hard if you can build anything. 70, 70 cents on the dollar unless you're doing good. Oh well let me ask you if you own the material, then you're probably definitely around 60 cents on a dollar or less. I'd say probably uh I mean yeah probably lower though. I mean all the material got um uh 20 by 52 um 2 I think it's like 18 or 17 something 2
Speaker 2:
times you uh please check real quick uh that my email if my email went
Speaker 1:
through. 725. Well, about 2180 2180 yep, uh, two car garage, but you can, we, we're able to fit 4 cars in there. Uh, we had to do some moving around. I'll tell him I fit 5 in here. You would have put some sideways, um, yeah. Yeah, the metal roofs are nice. Put them up in a day. Spray foam in a couple hours. That's the next thing we're gonna buy is a spray foam machine. Oh yeah, that's, uh, definitely a, uh. Of value. No, I do not. Let me go.
Speaker 2:
I'll make sure. Oh yeah, there's a lot of attachments that could have went to. Oh, that right here. I'll pull up here. Yeah, that's it.
Speaker 1:
It's that D E R R O C K H O W. Yeah, yeah, I come, that's it.
Speaker 2:
OK, sometimes it goes to when there's attachments.
Speaker 1:
So, um, for you guys' company, I just wanna make sure that I'm, I'm, I'm hearing you clearly. uh, I may have to go and look at the website as I, I will. OK, there it is, Paul. Oh yeah, got it, got it. OK. So your, your, you all's business model is, is a lot more extensive than basically what you guys are doing now. I'm gonna show this to you. I put a pause on this. This is in DeSoto, Texas. Um, we were looking at um. Uh, bringing a turnkey solution to the table for different municipalities that were trying to meet the mandate of all of that money that Biden passed for, uh, infrastructure, you know, charging stations that people could get in and out of in 30 minutes. The issue that I ran into, so I, I'd put this together. This is just kind of um conceptual model of what we were looking at doing, um. And that's Uh, boy, let me see, this is just a bunch of reading information. But anyway, let me pull up the pictures. So here's the issue that we ran into. We ran into. My renderings here. So we ran into issues with uh I've got a, I've got a couple of colleagues that work for Encore. Hm. And uh we what we ran into in this this area behind here would be the access closets to all of the electrical distribution behind here. The issue is that these EV charging stations were very, very, um, they, they had a lot of demand, like 300 amps, uh 300 amps in order to charge your car. And for the charge in about 30 minutes or less, those charging stations draw a lot. Yeah, so this, this was in order to meet the mandate from the requirements you have to have a minimum of 6 spaces. Um, A minimum of 6 spaces that had to be at least, you know, 1 mile or so. Off the highway. All right. So this is the model that we came up with to we, we were looking at, you know, accommodating about 10 spaces in the beginning, but by the time we got all of the factual data and information from the utility company. My guy is actually in the design department. He said, man, he said, Derek, it is going to, they're gonna bury your paperwork. I said why? He said, because that you, you're wanting a 1500. Amp service, 1500, that is like. Uh, a department store. And even though the money is allocated, everybody got their pot of money. The utility companies have to work, you know, like your best friend, and he said, man, nobody in this department or anybody even wants to entertain what it's gonna take. So he was just telling me, I'm gonna be honest with you, he said, man, they're gonna lose your paperwork. They're gonna keep losing your paperwork. Yeah. And I put a pause on it. When he told me that, I was like, man, I'm, I'm not gonna just spin my wheels fooling with this if there's no way to do this in such a way that it makes sense on the demand side. So it looks great and I spent money getting renderings done, meet with my architect, as you can see, I got all this done ready to submit it to the city of De Soto presentation and proposal all ready to go. But um. There is just. A bottleneck and maybe your guy if he works with Tesla or worked with them. I'd love to find out if the technology is changing. In such a way, I mean, that's our company and this was already ready to go, presented by Turnkey Solutions. I never even submitted it and the reason that I didn't, in spite of the fact that they got money, is that I'm not gonna waste my time. If I, if I can't see the finish line and know that I can get there, then I'm not gonna start, especially if you tell me there's a big old pothole when you get to the 50 yard line and you're not gonna get past that without, you know, breaking your legs. I'm like, and my guy was just transparent enough. With the at the utility company, he said, man, you, you're gonna have a problem. We, everybody is talking about the same thing. So they
Speaker 2:
just don't wanna, they just don't wanna the utility just doesn't wanna mess with it.
Speaker 1:
It, it's, it's, it's not that they don't want to, but You, you know what happened with Texas, right? Texas, a lot of people got killed a couple of years ago.
Speaker 2:
460 people, yeah, and,
Speaker 1:
and you know, because the same issue that they have here, PEPCO, the, the whole grid demand is inadequate. It's inadequate. So if it's already inadequate, and you're gonna suck up 1500 amps to charge 10 cars in one location. Can you imagine how much more demand that's gonna put on a uh um a grid that does not perform already. It doesn't perform. Can you imagine what that looks like if he said, Derek, I love your plan. It is great. I showed them locations and everything with this eminent domain we can take this portion of the land and pull right up. They
Speaker 2:
they don't wanna add the draw on the grid. No,
Speaker 1:
they don't, and, and nobody is seeing this, so there's no trade-off. You want us to give you 1500 amps unless somebody can come up with a plan and maybe your guy does know of technology that's coming out because what's killing this on a different level. Is the fact that there is so much demand from an EV
