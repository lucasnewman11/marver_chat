Speaker 1:
In nothing major get the deck fixed. Uh, the toilet change in one of the bathrooms, um, yeah, and we haven't really worked on any improvements yet. But uh we'll probably do like a remodeling of one of the bathrooms, um. But we do it in batches because you know we already spent so much money on the house so we can't can't do like any major uh undertake any major uh projects yet. Are you a finished basement finished. It's a bunch of basement. There's, uh, this backyard. It's a, it's a nice, uh, we like the this one.
Speaker 2:
We, uh, we, I've been all over, um, for this job takes me all over the district and northwest like this area it's pretty chill and, um, especially like I, I think like, you know, I don't look too much into the housing market, but Um, this is like a really solid place. Like it's not too expensive, but there's a lot of variety and not too far from anything. That's right.
Speaker 1:
And it's also not too close to the to the madness, you know, so it's a, it's a nice distance.
Speaker 2:
I'm looking at all. Um, I'm, I'm looking at purchasing next year if, uh, interest rates come down a bit, um, and I've been starting to look at places over here. Oh,
Speaker 1:
are you looking in the area
Speaker 2:
I live in the craziness. I live down towards Navy Yard.
Speaker 1:
Oh I see. I mean It's, it's nice. I have a friend living there, so. It's not a bad place, but he lives there because his office is closed, so that's why he chose to live there, um. But where are you uh taking your mind? Where, where? Oh yeah,
Speaker 2:
like, uh, I've been looking all over like Northwest, uh, a little bit like Northeast, uh, I'm like just starting. I, I've never bought a house before, um, but yeah, I'm just kind of like seeing, I really want something with like a basement unit so I could like rent out the basement and use that like a lot of people do that, right, right.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, the only thing is with, I, I'm pretty sure you know it, uh, that as a first time home owner, if you rent out part of your house, unless you do it like unofficially. Um, but if you do it officially, then you don't get like, uh, like a tax, uh, uh, the tax advantage or a tax benefit as a first time homeowner.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, that's good to know.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, huh. So you might want to consider maybe renting it out to a friend and you know, not declaring. You gave me a, you give me a break on rent, yeah. Well, but, but then, I mean, as long as you're doing it with a friend, but you know if you do it with the, I also have heard like horror stories where people just then refuse to leave, uh, so you know you got the squatter problem as well, so yeah, there's, uh, there's that, but yeah. But anyway, something to, uh, you know, so, uh, my, I was, uh, I was telling, uh, Martin, right, uh, that, uh, my wife is gonna be here and she would be more informed in having this conversation. So yeah, I just told her she'd be getting up as
Speaker 2:
that's fine, yeah.
Speaker 1:
Oh, did the Amazon package come in?
Speaker 2:
Um, one of them did. Yes, yeah, I think probably all of them because I think they all said, uh, I think one came a day early and then they should be here because I got a notification.
Speaker 1:
Cool. So. For Cool
Speaker 2:
Is your work pretty close to here, or do you work from home?
Speaker 1:
Uh, work is about 24 minutes' drive from here. It's um. Um, it's close to the White House, yeah, close to the White House, it's uh. It's about 4 blocks from the White House, yeah, I'm 21st in Pennsylvania. OK, right on. Yeah, so does my, my wife is on 19th in Pennsylvania and I work just 2 blocks from there.
Speaker 2:
OK. Do you guys like ride to work together or
Speaker 1:
we do, yeah, I mean, quite often we do, um, but then we also have like, uh, uh, you know, at times we're working from home, so it's not, it's, it's, it's not very regular, you know, that we drive. But when we do get the opportunity, we do.
Speaker 2:
Right on. Mar Martin said
Speaker 1:
you guys had a,
Speaker 2:
a hybrid.
Speaker 1:
Uh, plug-in hybrid, yes. What one do you have? Uh, it's a it's a. Oh, they make these, uh. Uh, they make these, uh, plug-in hybrids as well. Salara. Hi. Good morning. Hi. That's my wife Sana. Hello, my name is Paul. Yeah, I told them. So Yeah, Martin can give you, uh, or Paul can give you a quick intro on what they're doing. Sure,
Speaker 2:
yeah. Did, uh, son, did you and Martin talk at all when he stopped by the other day, or?
Speaker 1:
I wasn't here. No, you are here. OK,
Speaker 2:
no worries.
Speaker 1:
He spoke to me. He came, uh, yeah, he came by once and then he, he was in the neighborhood again. So yeah, the time we were meeting Martin. Oh wow, yeah,
Speaker 2:
um, well, yeah, we help people with the free solar program in DC, um, said you're a little bit more informed or looked into it a little bit more.
Speaker 1:
I did, but I didn't. Yeah, I didn't find anything. Yeah, so please, yeah, start from the beginning.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, you probably haven't heard of our company besides Martin Soft by. Sustainable You is the organization we represent, and we're kind of like an advocacy group and uh what's different, like the reason kind of we got into business in about 2019 is. There's a million installers here and it's all good. There's a bunch of great programs, the incentives are crazy. You can do it for free, but it's like you kind of don't know what like you're going to get with each installer and then we found a lot of people, they like, you know, like reach out to like 5 different companies and they, they get tired of it and then just never do it. So we just started putting installs through pretty much every installer. Um, we're partnered with about 80% of them now, and it's our mission just to make going solar here in DC is just as easy and rewarding as possible so that you can get a really good experience. And after doing about 1600 of these, uh, most of our projects go through solar solution or ROI construction. Um, and if you look into solar at all, solar solution. They've done like 6000 projects here. They've been doing it for 17 years. They're the most reliable by far, um, for insult timelines and just quality of work, and that's why we primarily use them for the free solar program.
Speaker 1:
OK, cool. So how does the program work?
Speaker 2:
Yeah. Do you know about the Energy Act they passed a couple years ago?
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I, it just keeps coming up when I look it up, but then I don't know more about it. So tell me.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, a lot more people are looking into it now, um, in case like because like things might change like next year with the new administration, but for now we still have a mandate for 100% clean energy in DC, uh, 8 years from now in 2032. Yeah. Oh, it's OK.
Speaker 1:
Is that OK?
Speaker 2:
I usually take it back. Yeah, that's perfect.
Speaker 1:
Uh, do you want any sugar? No thanks.
Speaker 2:
I'm good, thank you though.
Speaker 1:
That's a new mug, huh? Yeah, I, I just found it in the back. Right on. Hey, where did you find it? I've never seen it before. I put it there.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, break it into the. Um, thank you so much.
Speaker 1:
Thank you.
Speaker 2:
So the, the really unique thing in DC is that uh mandate for the clean power, uh, not only do we have to hit 100% in like 8 years, all of that clean energy must be produced inside the district. Like they can't ship it in from like like a solar field in New Jersey, and PEPCO would love to just build it. solar fields, there's a couple of them here, but they don't really own any land, so people's rooftops is like, you know, the only place to put it. So pretty much everyone's roof space just became prime real estate and they're willing to pay top dollar because every time they help pay for someone's solar system, they avoid like an even larger fine. So we're at a point now where like the incentives for it are more expensive or more like like they're higher than the cost of the system, so they're willing to pay all the cost of the system. So you get free solar. It's a fixed 0% electric rate. All the power that the system produces is for is free and goes to home first. If you make more than you need, they'll pay you for it. Um, if it only covers like half your bill, then cool, you'll just get your first X amount of power for free.
Speaker 1:
OK.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, that's pretty much it. It's pretty simple.
Speaker 1:
Sounds good, so I guess I'm still. So based on the stuff that I found online, there still seems to be like an installation sort of cost around it, right? So, I don't know, it's looking at something around. 2025K.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, like if you. Um, a lot of people look up like energy sage. Let's try to connect to. Please go back to hotspots.
Speaker 1:
right, if you want. I mean, they're not exactly cookies. It's more like a biscotti. Oh perfect scotti from. Oh
Speaker 2:
definitely.
Speaker 1:
Well, thank you. Mm, I would say don't play. So. Cha.
Speaker 2:
Do you have a Wi Fi I could log into?
Speaker 1:
Um, you could use um hotspot. I give you mine, mine, mine's
Speaker 2:
yeah, if you, yeah,
Speaker 1:
I
Speaker 2:
don't know
Speaker 1:
why my phone. I have like two data plans. One's like AT&T and then one's like Xfinity something's been off um. But my 18T1 works way better here in the district. Well it
Speaker 2:
just turn it back. Detecting, yeah, I mean this is not bad. No,
Speaker 1:
nothing
Speaker 2:
popped
Speaker 1:
up yet. Nope, you're connected.
Speaker 2:
I'm connected. Yep, no, it's like connecting to like an Xfinity Wi Fi. Let me try forgetting that network. Like I don't even see
Speaker 1:
that's my phone. iPhone connect. So.
Speaker 2:
Oh OK. This is what I was trying to pull up. Um, if you pull up like oh it's like energy sage, it's like one of the top things that pull up when uh you pull up solar. So if I just like Chop competing quotes from Solar. What's the zip code here?
Speaker 1:
20011.
Speaker 2:
And then it's gonna show you.
Speaker 1:
So a monthly bill is like 250. What's your address? 5325. 5th Street. OK,
Speaker 2:
hopefully it doesn't make me sign up for something.
Speaker 1:
Sure Oh,
Speaker 2:
it might. Oh, OK. Um, if you look up like general or quotes online, um, there's even something like on the DOE website, and it'll, it'll give you a bunch of prices for some systems and like especially the energy age uh website, it'll recommend these companies and it's like, hey, this quote would be for this amount for that, that amount. It's like, OK. Um, but a lot of those companies, like, you know, sometimes it'll be like a really cheap one, and it's like a company from Texas and they'll like subcontract the insult to, you know, someone that hasn't done any insult here before and it's like, yeah, you can get a really good deal, but like they don't even like on that website, like it's a national website has a lot of good info on like how solar works, but there's nothing even about the free solar program and it is very new. It's only been around for like 2 years, um. Basically what I'm saying like you can buy it and if you like want there to be an installation cost, you can, and then there's like some extra incentives that you get, but like 95% of our clients do the free program because there's absolutely no costs. There's no install costs. We'll never ask for your payment information. You're just locked at a zero cent rate, and they'll do that for you because when they pay for your system, they end up getting some of those long-term incentives from the city, so. They're happy to do it for free because they'll make all their money back in a certain amount of time and then so what does that look like? Yeah, what that looks like is you pay like $230 for a solar system and then, you know,
Speaker 1:
no, no, wait, the one that you're talking about
Speaker 2:
the one that I'm talking about is free solar,
Speaker 1:
so free insulation and then. Let's say I'm paying, like I said, I'm paying 250 $250 a month and like on average, but let's say peak season I'm paying 300 and, yeah, in September I probably paid like 200. So some of it would come off the grid, or let's say most of it comes off the grid in the month of September. The company makes money back. What is the ratio or like how does that work or does it take all of it back? Do I get any rebate or?
Speaker 2:
Great question. Um, there's something on your bill that will let me show you exactly how that would work. And on the third page, they put all of your usage, uh, well, since July, um, when you moved in, and I plug in on those values to Um, this program, I have a design for the housemaid to, I'll, I'll show you guys like what it would look like. And then I'll be able to say like, hey, it'll cover X amount of your power, and here's how it would look for you throughout the year. Do you have a, a, OK. It's Do you know any like friends or family that have done solar here?
Speaker 1:
Yeah,
Speaker 2:
right on.
Speaker 1:
But I don't think Yeah, I think they paid for it when they got it.
Speaker 2:
Oh.
Speaker 1:
How long has the uh free solar program in place?
Speaker 2:
It's been about 2 years, 2 years, yeah. Our organization, uh, we were the first ones to start it, but now a lot of, a lot of operate
Speaker 1:
here. When did I get it? 2 years ago. But she, she didn't get the free program, right? OK. Should be on my computer. One of these No. Do you want, do you want your computer? Uh, I think I'm almost there. I think we make too much everyday on. Just what? I as a body member You know in the OK Mm So you're, you're not going back home still. Um, so the plans changed. Um, I liked DC so much. I asked him like because I'm staying with him, and then he was like, yeah, for sure. And then like something like a week, and then my dad called me and he was like, hey, like we're thinking about flying to like Philadelphia, and, and you're super close. Uh, we'll fly, you drive, we'll do Thanksgiving in Philadelphia for a couple of days, and we all drive back together back to Michigan. So I was like, OK, I just got to convince him, like, let me say where it is. He's like, Hey, Paul, can I say where it is? And he's like, yeah, for sure. Like, it's been so good. We help a lot of people like, it's been, it's been great. And I was like, OK, thank guys. Um, so yeah, we're gonna go drive to Philadelphia on the twenty-seventh, and then the next day we have like a big, uh big family, um, like Thanksgiving. Being uh my dad's friend in Philly, uh, so it'll be really fun and then we're all gonna drive back home. Um, and then December, uh, I have a, so over the summer I built a couple of houses and, uh, I built a couple of cars. I'm not gonna pay 2 houses, 3 cars and um I need to sell a couple of these cars and finish up working on a couple of these houses in December and then um I think after that, like January, I'm gonna come back out here and move out here for, uh, you know, longer term. As long as the free program exists, I want to be out here because I actually met him in New Mexico. We were like selling solar out there, you know, saving people a little, a lot of money, like more than like half or more than half of their bill. Uh, then he came out here and started doing free solar. I'm like, What are you talking about? Like, no. So yeah, it's like in August. OK, so can I tell you, on the 212 32. No, on the day on the 1265957962. Have you made the drive to Philadelphia like many times, multiple times. no, I mean, I've driven to gas heat in but not sure is it that I think it's all right. Most people are gas, yeah, so that must be gas, yeah, that I just never understand. Yeah I was gonna be my first trip. I just don't know what to expect. Like, I was thinking about leaving like really early in the morning, so I don't get any traffic. Yeah, I, I can't really say about, you know, people traveling on the Thanksgiving break, but otherwise, I mean, when I traveled, it was when I drove, you know, it was fine. I left around 11. It was, uh, it was a Saturday, so it was fine. I, I was, I was worried. I was like I'm gonna leave here at like 7 a.m. or 6 or something. Yeah, I mean, depending on what time you're trying to get there. So, OK, yeah, I'm excited for it. It fun. I like Philly a lot. I spent a lot of time out there. Yeah, I've only been a couple of times, so I'm looking forward now. So how far is the drive? How long is the 2.5 hours. Yeah, by the way, these are great. Good. Well, what's the difference between the two? 01 is chocolate flavored. Oh, OK, to try it. I don't want. There's only 4 chocolates. No, no, it's fine. I actually prefer the other 10 really? Yeah. The other one is like you insist, if you insist, thank you. This is an experimental one, yeah.
Speaker 2:
This is about what you could fit on the roof, and then I'll, I'll show you the production in in a sec. There, you do have a lot of uh vents up on the roof, which prevents us from putting more panels. A lot of times those can be, they can be like trimmed. Um, so I'd say this is like the minimum we could do, but um, after the roof is surveyed, you know, those are ones we can cut down, then it's like, OK, we can have like 4 or 5 more panels for you.
Speaker 1:
I, because the roof was probably done like 5 years ago, I would need a replacement in like 2 to 3 years. How does that affect this so that if they redo the roof, they have to take the whole thing out and then put it back on. Yeah.
Speaker 2:
It's a removal, which it will happen at some point because the warranty on the production at like year 30, they'll still be like 90% output as they are in year one. So they're going to be up there a very long time, uh, viably and so overall, yeah, at some point you'll need your roof replaced if it's been 5 years. Loss replacement, like you'll be good unless you're having like severe problems and leaks. Uh,
Speaker 1:
they usually say it's like around the 8 mark it's like 10 or 15 are usually pretty good. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
we can, um, also too, it's a lot of times it's easy to do like a roof coating which is like way better. Than a full replay because if it's only 5 years old, then it's like you're kind of throwing away like, you know, maybe 5 or 7 years of roof life left. So you could just put a coating over it, which is like way cheaper. It'll protect it and then it's like, hey, you might not, you probably won't have to worry about doing a roof replace with the panels on top for another 10 or 15 years after that.
Speaker 1:
But, but in general, like, you know, uh, let's forget about our roof, but when there's a roof replacement due and the solar panels are also installed, how does that work?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, great question. Do you give me or anyone at the same way you call, um, say, hey, like we're gonna replace our roof. And it's like cool, and we are not only partnered with a bunch of the solar installers here, we have a lot of good roofing partners. So we'd have the, we'd come out, we take the panels off, we do the new roof for you, we put the panels back on and then you'd be good to go.
Speaker 1:
OK. At, at, at a cost,
Speaker 2:
there's a fee for it. It's not free to, uh, do the removals, um, the way we make it, uh, like because you're not gonna do solar if you're gonna have to pay like an extra $500 for a roof, uh, to take it off and put it back on. Um, there is a fee for it, but because we're there for the roof, we save on a lot of cost doing that. A lot of times we just do the roof at cost because they're, um, able to use funding for the program to help with it. So it's uh it's usually a little little bit more expensive than a new roof and uh usually isn't too bad because then you're still saving like, you know, like thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars so it's usually a pretty good trade-off, yeah. Right. Um, a good, good question. And as far as the power goes. OK. So we don't obviously don't have your full year of usage. However, this system, it would produce uh about 400, 8500 kilowatt hours of energy for the year.
Speaker 1:
OK,
Speaker 2:
so.
Speaker 1:
That's about
Speaker 2:
About 16 cent electric rate right now. So you'd get your 1st $1350 of power for free. And it's like if you end up using more, if you use more than that, you'll just drop from PEPCO at whatever rate you'll just get your 1st 1300 dollars or
Speaker 1:
so. We did, right? We did use more. Um, we had, we use more like as I expected we used more in like August and September um. So I'm just trying to, I just divided this by 12. To do like a monthly average
Speaker 2:
for what it would produce,
Speaker 1:
yeah, is that, is that right?
Speaker 2:
What was the number you came up with? No,
Speaker 1:
no, I just divided this by 12 because that's annual, right? Yeah,
Speaker 2:
that's the annual production, so it would save you an average of $112 a month.
Speaker 1:
Oh, so you multiply it by the cost. So yeah, he's he's basically taking that and the unit cost of energy, but she, she was trying to compare it with what we actually consume. Oh yeah yeah. So this is uh 8448 divided by 12 would be the monthly uh some months it's over in some months in summer it would be over. And presumably, yeah, OK, yeah, I mean, it's an estimate, what is our estimated annual consumption? You don't have one.
Speaker 2:
I can kind of estimate it. Um, currently from what's on your bill, you have about 4800. For the 4 months, yeah, so, yeah, yeah. It is kind of higher, so like I'd be, I don't think it would cover your whole bill because especially with how like those red bars there is what the is what you're using gold is the uh system. So like November or like wintertime is when your bill might be a little higher,
Speaker 1:
but also production is lower. It's not sunny.
Speaker 2:
But even like
Speaker 1:
I don't know.
Speaker 2:
And we can help with like a home energy audit um like we get to come by after the install and we kind of like go through all your appliances and like see um it might, it might be um because you do you plug in the hybrid every day? That might be it. Which is still better, yeah, yeah, sometimes it's it's tricky with those, and
Speaker 1:
is there like a rebate for a hybrid that yeah, there's a there's a program for hybrids as well. I'm
Speaker 2:
pretty sure there is,
Speaker 1:
yeah. I wasn't sure how it works though, um. But yeah, but there is a plan. I got a new toilet seat and we still get some rebate on that, so I think the city gets rebates for everything. Oh,
Speaker 2:
it's crazy,
Speaker 1:
yeah, so a new toilet seat like if it's, I don't know, a certain flush whatever.
Speaker 2:
Pepco hybrid
Speaker 1:
rebate. You're talking about like a new plugin because you're telling me you have like a 110 volt plugin, right? Right. And you were talking about like operating it to like 220. No, no, yeah, I mean I just said I don't have it, uh, but yeah, I mean I guess rate so it's like if you're, I mean there's like you're charging the cheaper, yeah, they just charge but that's universal, right? Like that's not you don't have to sign into this I don't think. But more efficient, you know. Oh, you think so. Did you enroll in this program last year? No, I did not because I wasn't sure how it works. Application to plug in at Pepco.com. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
there is a the there's the default rate, um, which is the one you're, I would imagine you're on right now if you haven't applied for anything, but then there's the rate option uh for electric vehicles traveling at least 30 miles using electricity, fuel without the use of gas. Yeah, I would, uh, I can send you this link, um, and yeah, I'd apply for it, see if you can get it, and then, uh, you'll probably save on some power for the charging, ma'am.
Speaker 1:
Cool. OK, so this is cool. So, OK, so then this is what we get, but we're not, I guess we're still paying something, right? So 112, you said 112 in savings, but how am I saving if I'm spending more than producing.
Speaker 2:
So on these months, like those, uh, the gold bar there, like you would get that gold bar for like that's free power and then the overage of that, OK, OK,
Speaker 1:
is what you're so then let's say I pay about $150 a month, so 150 minus 112 is what I would have to pay then, right?
Speaker 2:
On average,
Speaker 1:
on average, on average I pay 150, on average 112. So you're paying this is not net, this is just gross production. So yeah, so I pay about 37, which is. OK, OK, which is plug in hybrid, um. OK, so then what share of this goes back, or is this already taking the net because you said that then some goes back to the, only the extra goes back if you're consuming under what we're producing. Oh, the extra goes back. OK, OK. So then you, no one makes money off this. So for the environment,
Speaker 2:
you make money off of it if you're someone who's overproducing, uh, a lot of power, like, for example, Um, I'll pull up one of the other designs. Um, who did we, did we sit
Speaker 1:
with? I was gonna say you have. She's like like 15 or 200. Do you remember that uh is this a simulator? It's kind of a simulator, right? We don't even have full data points.
Speaker 2:
Um, the simulation. Is 20 years of weather data.
Speaker 1:
Can you look up there, the only other house that has solar on the block. What are they doing? Let's see, see how much they're producing coverage, yeah,
Speaker 2:
so that's what I hope we could do with yours, uh, with the vents there.
Speaker 1:
I mean, 2 are just sunroofs, right? So, I guess you can't really cover.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, we wouldn't wanna cover your sunroof for you, but I would imagine um.
Speaker 1:
And that's a chimney or whatever. Yeah, right there. So that's how the sunroof is out, but what about those those empty spots in between?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, these are panels won't really fit in any of these spots, um, because of the, the events that are there, like if I go.
Speaker 1:
Oh, I see.
Speaker 2:
Yeah.
Speaker 1:
Uh,
Speaker 2:
we may be able to, uh, we may be able to cut those, and I would say like 123, maybe 4 or 5 extra panels if Um, if we're able to cut those and put them over,
Speaker 1:
OK, uh, can we check the neighbor's output based on the, uh, we can't, I don't know
Speaker 2:
that. No, it'd be
Speaker 1:
nice, but I was no, no, I mean not the neighbors. I mean, I meant like, um, if we were to or you. Even simulate that on our own rooftop as well. I just want to see that if we were fully optimizing the use of the solar panels just a couple more. I didn't mean to like actually check on the neighbors, but there's where it was like fully covered, right? so.
Speaker 2:
For me, I'm a copy it. And then, let me show you what it would do if we're able to go over those fences. And let me just delete all those.
Speaker 1:
Maybe keep like the two because I don't know if you'll be able to take all of them out.
Speaker 2:
Um, like
Speaker 1:
which I don't know, doesn't matter, go for it. Just Mhm Uh, so we probably do. So all right.
Speaker 2:
Oh,
Speaker 1:
that will. Oh yeah, I would How's the chocolate one? Good. Which one do you like better? The the villa, right, yeah, I think it's, is it vanilla? I don't think so. Yeah, whatever it is, yeah, that's good. No, the, the chocolate was, uh, experimental. That's the first time I actually heard about it. So where do you guys get this? This is, there's, uh, this Pakistani, um, store bakery and, um. Chantly, Virginia, it's about 45 minutes' drive from here, yeah, that's where we got it from, so this is. Very reminiscent of home. Oh really? OK, is it just a bakery? Are there, are there more like Pakistani restaurants and like shops or like like grocery stores around there? Yeah, there are plenty, but even this place, it's not just a bakery. They didn't get your vision before, but I get it now you know this is what we likely we ran out of the dessert and
Speaker 2:
that's more like. They mostly daily basis,
Speaker 1:
so if you're, you know, if you're lactose intolerant, yeah, I just destroyed Tres Leche's cake yesterday. Oh man, I'm half Peruvian chicken and whiskey, like a Peruvian chicken place and it was so good. Yeah, we really like that you say you're half Peruvian that we have a couple of like places like that like you know like bakeries or like grocery stores you can get like items from. Um, so we had to drive like an hour, an hour and a half we load it up and
Speaker 2:
that's pretty typical for people is around, uh, maybe like 8000 to 12,000 kilowatt hours. So 10,000 kilowatt hours is pretty good. Um, obviously you'll probably have a little bit more because of the plug in, um, but that's where like yeah, like like August,
Speaker 1:
yeah, but still the the the gold bars is still under the our usage then. Yeah, we're still using more. OK.
Speaker 2:
And if we're able to do that,
Speaker 1:
what's the, yeah, what's the saving on that?
Speaker 2:
It would take your savings from like 1300 up to that'd be more like 1700 bucks
Speaker 1:
for the year, yeah. All right, so that's about $35 extra per month, around that, yeah, 35 to $40.
Speaker 2:
Well, if it's, uh, if you're going off like a 100 like if your average bill is 150. This would save you like $143 a month. So. Pretty much get most of it. OK, yeah. That's like that's ideal, um, if we get the advances
Speaker 1:
you think that's uh that's doable.
Speaker 2:
I would think so. Um, I obviously don't, I'm pretty conservative. I like to be conservative on these, um, because I, I hate to be like, hey, you know, you're gonna get like all these savings, and then I'd rather, yeah,
Speaker 1:
under commit over deliver.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, like even that, um, the data set we use for the weather, it's like from like 1975 to 2005 weather data, and it's like there's way more sun hours now than that so. Everyone we go back to, it's like they're usually producing a little more than than we tell them, and that I'd rather have it be like that than um be have people complaining like, hey, this is the pretty lips he said. Oh, and you don't have any shade, um, so this is like a really efficient system. Like the threshold for them, it does have to be efficient enough for them to do it for free, and it's like that all they're looking for is like at least 900 kilowatt hours per kilowatt of system size, and this is doing like uh 1, 1260. So it's really efficient and you're getting a lot out of it and Um, those ones are even better because when you have to pay for it, it's like you don't have to like um like optimize it for what you're using and like. And it's like, hey, just get as much as you can and you know, hey, if it covers the whole bill, great, if it only covers half your bill, that it's like, hey, it's, it's still like, you know, $1300 1500 dollars, $1700 that you don't have to worry about and OK,
Speaker 1:
yeah. Sounds good to me. No, I think I asked all my questions and there's absolutely, once again, you know, no cost, there's no patch, nothing. Yeah, you need to look out for something. Yeah, I mean, it all sounds too good to be true. So that's keeping
Speaker 2:
this. Oh yeah, and you're right too. Like that's like the main thing for people is like, um, you've never done anything like this and you'll there's probably never do anything like it again because it's the the catch is, is like when you do the free one, you don't get the incentives and that's like the installer is paying for it. They're playing the long game. They're looking at like 30 years and what they're going to be able to make off the incentives in that time and it can be really cool, but like. I mean, most people don't have 3000 line around to buy a solar system with and financing is like 10-11% interest right now. So it's like, uh, the free ones are a lot better, um, or a lot easier and then it's like, hey, if you want to buy it in the future you can always, um, purchase it at a later date. But
Speaker 1:
um for the question, what about maintenance and other stuff that comes with it, um.
Speaker 2:
That's also why the free one is so good, uh, because you're not paying a dime for it, they're funding the whole thing. They're taking full responsibility for any maintenance, anything that goes wrong, and there's two things that could usually go wrong. It's like, number one, it's like an act of God. Like if like a hailstorm comes through or if a tree falls on it or something, that's covered by the installer and, uh, most people's homeowners insurance too, it's like already in your policy and if it's not, it's like $30 a year and you can even use that as like a backup too. And that's all on them. And then the second thing that could go wrong is like if you have like a defective panel or like I mean it's 30 years. I don't promise anyone I feel like nothing's gonna go wrong. Like most common thing is like the, the inverter will go out. It, uh, um, that's not, that's the inverter. It's not where we put it. It's just a representation, but it converts the power from DC to AC that the home can use. Let's say like you're. It, it just busts out. The system's fully monitored, so you can like get on your phone and like see what each panel's doing and keep track of everything. We have access to that too. So if something's not working right, then uh we'll be giving you a call and saying, hey, like we know your burger went out. Can we come out on Friday to pick, uh, fix it up for you? And as long as you don't get up on your roof and start smashing it with a hammer, uh, you won't be responsible for any, um. Any of the, any fixes if there are any, and there's no moving parts, there's no regular maintenance, um, yeah.
Speaker 1:
And that that's valid for the entire lifetime of the of the setup,
Speaker 2:
yeah, um 30 years,
Speaker 1:
right?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, it's I wouldn't say lifetime because the, I mean 90% production at year 30, they might be up there longer than I'm here, um, but it's, uh, they do 20 years and then you can uh just renew it for another 10 and you get a total of 30 years of those coverages. Right. And um that's where to the, the application, they're, they're like super clear that like um that's usually what I show people like, hey, it's, they say it's like $0 like a million times on there and um yeah, all, all it is is you just send in the free solar application, they'll give you a call um next day or so to uh schedule the site survey. They'll come out, they'll hop up on your roof, they'll take pictures and measurements, they'll look at your breaker box. Make sure everything is good to go. If it all checks out, then we'll send that to PEPCO for approval, and then they'll look at everything, and then we'll send that to the Department of Buildings for building permits. Once we have all the necessary approvals for it, then we'll be out and it is like a 3 or 4 month process. Um, they The free is easy, but it's not like it's like there's a lot of red tape, like if we don't have like the right colors of ties on things, if we have stickers in the wrong spots, then they, they'll deny it. So like uh it is like we do have to be very um thorough and making sure this is gonna be good for people and you know, that they get out of it what they want to get out of it and um. But yeah, there's really only like 3 days I need to be here for it, um, after applying. Uh, first day is today, so thanks for being here. Um, but yeah, you'll let them in, you'll need to let them in to check the breaker box on the site survey and then uh someone will need to be here for install day and, uh, that's like our job just to manage the project all the way up until install and uh not only that, but the lifetime of the system and Uh, really helps too, because these companies are like they're huge and things can fall through the cracks and like I'm personally watching these like uh every day on where they're progressing. This is like a bunch of our projects and it's like, you'll start over here and then there's like a million things you need to check on and eventually you'll be install ready and get an install date, um, but we'll let you know when PECO approval comes in and the DOB permits, and then if there's any important updates in between, I'll be the first to let you know, and I'm your best point of contact to um for anything you need.
Speaker 1:
All right. Sounds good. Um. OK, so wait, so what's the company called again? because I forgot that at the beginning sustainable sustainable you. OK, so no, thank you. I think this looks good. I don't have any other questions. I just want to look it up and feel satisfied that it won't go out of business anytime soon. And I think that's probably it. And then I will um yeah. And then we can, so we, we just, I have Martin's contact and we can get your contact as well and how do we, so once we do a bit of our own research as well and then we really that otherwise it seems fine yeah I think it's a no brainer otherwise we're just gonna look for any final, you know. Any fine prints or yeah, anything that you know we uh and I think we should be good to go after that so we can get in touch with you guys um or is it, is there an online application system did you say
Speaker 2:
it has to be with me.
Speaker 1:
It has to be with you,
Speaker 2:
OK, to do in person because they, they like call like uh like 1 out of 10 people, um, after the survey and like make sure I like went through the whole. Application with you so you know, like, uh, like everything that it's signed up for is construction, like a very thorough on it. It's like, you know, a lot of pages, so I do like to, you know, go through that with people so they know what they're getting into and that's where like we, we like want to make sure you feel really good about it before you do it, um, but if it sounds good then great, um, do as much like due diligence and whatever, um, and whenever you feel good, we'll, uh, submit the application and if you have any other questions on it, I'd be more than happy to assess. Um, for it is really important to make sure you go with a company that isn't going out of business. Um, there's a lot of like national companies here like Sonova, Sunrun, they're like really big ones, a lot of them, those ones, they don't even do like flat roofs or the free program, um, but, uh, there are companies that are like, you know, during COVID, so. EPCs went bankrupt or you know, and it's like you don't want to put solar in your house and then company is not gonna be there. That's why we do a lot of these solar solution. They've been around the longest, 17 years. I don't know, um, you know, I don't have a magic ball like, hey, any anyone could go out of business, but, um, that's like, you know, your best shot, and then with an art like ours if, uh, solar solution went out of business for some reason. Uh, they do have a legal obligation to switch warranties over to another company that can maintain them or better, and we would just switch it over to another installer in our network, um, so that you're not left hanging, right? Yeah,
Speaker 1:
all right, sounds good. Yeah, yeah, sounds good. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
anything else I could help you with, or,
Speaker 1:
um, no, I think, uh, I, I guess, uh, just uh. Your contact information or we can contact you through Martin whichever way you think it's uh easier. I've got his number. We're friends now. I guess your number saved. Lots of numbers on my phone, like all these numbers
Speaker 2:
for you. Thank you. Yeah, I hope and I hope we could be friends. Like I, most of, I'm really happy you guys met Martin on the door. Um, most people that I try to work with is it's just like a bunch of referrals because like if you had a family member that went with us and like had a good experience, like it's like way easier. So I try to like work those a lot more. Um, so like, hopefully this will be a sort of a great relationship and um, yeah, uh, we'd be uh super happy to help you out with this and save some money and help the environment.
Speaker 1:
Sounds good. Just out of curiosity, do you have any um any solid leads here in the neighborhood? Are are any, are there any other people who are I could check to.
Speaker 2:
Or who is uh
Speaker 1:
who is the Yeah, Mohammed, he's uh a second house in on your street.
Speaker 2:
Let me see if we have any.
Speaker 1:
Yeah.
Speaker 2:
It's we're on 5th Street.
Speaker 1:
Because we're on a neighborhood WhatsApp group as well, so I just, you know, we'll just, we just wanna check with. Others what they're doing.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, ask people like who like what installer they did um. Which program if they did the free one. Um, yeah, I'm trying to see if we have any. Where are we? 5th Street. Over here. Or below Missouri. Martin, what's the like street we parked on? I have no idea.
Speaker 1:
I follow the blue line and go wherever it takes me. How far did you park from here? I just down the street over here one and then left. That's uh that's Ingram. Oh, I see that's Ingrahamgram.
Speaker 2:
And so. OK, I don't think those are installs.
Speaker 1:
Yeah we're, we're between Jefferson and Ingram.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I found that's OK. Um, we don't have any like right next to you. But this is like all down in DC. And I might have some personal clients, let me check.
Speaker 1:
You do the application Mm. The EV one, let me see. You have a couple on 8th Street. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I definitely do. They're like right next to each other. Zenith and uh Ben. Another one on Dellafield.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, these are the purple ones are people I've met with or are talking to, and then green ones are uh installs or like they've signed up. OK, so I got a couple more um crops like Missouri up there, but I'd look at, I would just look at like our. Like any other companies you hear, I would look up um. Just like Google
Speaker 1:
reviews. Of sustainable you. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
that and um. Like the installer.
Speaker 1:
Like 4. Reddit. Oh yeah, there's there's nothing on Reddit. My Google is now Reddit. Like I just type my question and then I'd on there. No, there's nothing on. I just looked it up. There's nothing on Reddit. That is good. I'm gonna post on Reddit.
Speaker 2:
I was thinking, I was thinking of starting like a uh like a Reddit page
