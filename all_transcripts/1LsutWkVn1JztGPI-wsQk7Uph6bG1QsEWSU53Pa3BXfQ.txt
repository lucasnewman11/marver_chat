Speaker 1:
And they had a 15 year old system that they just paid like cash for and it's gonna cost us like 1500 or something to like take it off. Like it's very cheap to buy out of like old systems. Your system in 30 years it might be not even worth it for them to do the work to take it off. It might not be worth that much. So like I'd say just like buy it or they'll probably just let you keep it at your 30.
Speaker 2:
OK. Um,
Speaker 1:
which is not a bad deal for, um, you know, 30 years of free power, and that might be a lot too much to think about right now, and you can also switch this to a purchase at any point in the process before install. So, the free one, I usually do that to just get the process started, and then if you're interested at all in the purchase, or if things change and end up looking more favorably, then you could definitely switch it over, um, probably sometime before the summer, which would, uh, maybe be towards when we would be installing
Speaker 2:
it. Sometimes for the summer. OK, so, so basically. Is there a few months between this. And, and I forget how the economics works. I, I apologize. I model and we're we're traveling in Vietnam, not right now, um. What uh. What was the, what was the total savings if like from. Over a 20 year period, I guess if you guys own the system. Um, I got
Speaker 1:
your system pulled up right
Speaker 2:
here.
Speaker 1:
So if you do the max system size, it'd be about 15,764 kilowatt hours. Current electric rate. So, just your first year savings would be about $3000 and if rates never went up over The next 30 years, 3000 times 30, that'd be like $90,000 like 100, but rates triple, like rate in like 20 years ago, electric was like 6 or 7 cents here, and now it's like 18.59, and they just passed another $124 million rate increase. So
Speaker 2:
we would be saying it's $2000 a year. Like
Speaker 1:
3000.
Speaker 2:
So 3000 years and 3000 a year now and then it could be like lightly, so this would say like 3000 years.
Speaker 1:
Yeah.
Speaker 2:
If we saw that with ourselves then we would get the value of the SE and. I I in that federal credit. But it sounds like that's over. Um So then it becomes Like there is like more investment up front but it becomes. Over the period a better payout, I think, um, OK, so I'm kind of fine with the idea that at least like preliminarily. Oh, it did, and then I wanted to understand why um why is it a little bit more urgent then if the economics still makes sense for the solar company even after they've got this like federal credit then. Why is it more urgent to do this now? The
Speaker 1:
tax credit coming in question. It is like really interesting for these, and if it definitely goes away, I think the point at which they not let people go free solar anymore gets a lot sooner cause like SA values like probably from when I first met you were like, you could get them like for 450 in Strak and now it's like 370 is where you're locking it in. And you lock that in like a month after you install, so like who knows what the price is gonna be in the summer. It could be like way lower. So that's why I like. Like, no, the program's not ending tomorrow, but we also like, you know, we probably won't get much notice when um when it does. So like, hey, like the free one's great, like at least have your application on file so like worst case scenario, the purchase option gets really bad, at least you can, you're like guaranteed the free one. As long as you have your application in, you're good to go. It'll like new changes would only affect um new applications.
Speaker 2:
OK, so you lock the in when you sign the application.
Speaker 1:
I know, so you, you lock the a value in when not only after is it after you get installed, you lock that in after the system gets turned on, which is like. A month later. And that's like, that's also like best case scenario, like I had maybe 2 or 3 clients last year that had all this back and forth with PEPCO, and it just drew the project out. I, I signed up, uh, this one guy, Tim, in March, and then he didn't install till like December, so it's like, I also can't guaran like guarantee a time frame on that too, and if it's like a year from now that you walked in that guys, like, who knows what's gonna happen before then,
Speaker 2:
so. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
but it's that's like, I mean, it's all, that's where it's like all within your risk tolerance like. The investors of these projects, like, it's like they have like millions and millions of dollars, like they're way smarter with money than I am, and they're still buying them, so. Um, like for them it will make sense, I guess, but it's like, you know, if the ROI goes like to like 8 or 9 or 10 years, and it's like, That's just like more risky for some people than it is for the investors, I guess,
Speaker 2:
but. Yeah, I mean,
Speaker 1:
it's up to you.
Speaker 2:
You have what's that? If we sign this today, it would probably wouldn't be until the summer that it would get installed, but there's the free solar option which would reduce our like electricity bill at low risk other than the fact that somebody else would own the stuff on our route. Correct, yeah.
Speaker 1:
And a lot of people also like that too, cause like. Because they pay for everything, like they, if anything breaks, like it like it's not like written in the contract as like an extra thing, but it's like, if the inverter goes out, they stop making money and they're out there really quick to like fix it. I mean, not that they're slow with like fixing. Um, like it when like you own it, but like they take all the risk and that's like pretty awesome when you're, it's like at least $100,000 of savings for 30 years, and I mean that's why most people do it, but you'd have plenty of time to see like What happens with the incentives and like, hey, like hopefully like they get better and we have free solar for like, you know, years more, but I mean. We got it now. That's all I can say.
Speaker 2:
OK, and is there any option to buy it out? Like before the 20 years from now.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, you get an option at year 6, and also I'd say, I'll say to you, like, we have a really good relationship with the installer, the developer, also, I mean, we bring a lot of business, the investor. If you wanted to work out something before that time, we'd be happy to facilitate that. It probably just wouldn't be a great deal, because they hadn't made all their money back at that point, um, but If you want to buy it, like, you know, 2 years after you get it and sold, I mean, we'll make it happen.
Speaker 2:
Oh Yeah. So you, you will be in default under this power purchase agreement if any one of the following occurs. A reserved. What does that mean? Um, let me pull up this.
Speaker 1:
I think it's just like a filler word. That's the one I remember is there.
Speaker 2:
Other
Speaker 1:
instances. I think it's just a filler word. I can take that out if uh if you'd like.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, probably, I'm not sure what the implications of that are. There was,
Speaker 1:
there's two instances of that. Let me take those
Speaker 2:
out. I'm just putting this back into old time. And I just uh.
Speaker 1:
How long have you been in uh Vietnam?
Speaker 2:
It's a couple of days, um, we're here for the um. My uh My wife and I and son are visiting her parents. Nice. OK I forget the um so. Again, I'm not looking at the model, so because I have two units, um. What did, what did we decide we're going to do about the like set up for the power? Are there going to be two systems or is it just gonna be one? Um,
Speaker 1:
that's up to you, and that's like something else we can talk about after the survey, um, cause you have the, you have the system size, you could, uh, you could probably do or we, yeah, 6 kilowatt minimum, so you could do 2 minimum systems and run it to both, which I think when we talked about that, I think if you, yeah, cause you would have overproduction at your Current, you're at the top unit, but you'd only get 12 cents back for uh the overproduction, but if you split it, it would cover like all the electrics, it's um you don't get that like 12 cents to 18 cents um. You can remember talking about that?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, so basically it's more valuable to cover any existing power needs rather than some. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
cause then all those co watts are worth 18 cents instead of 12 cents when you get about Pepco.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, so ideally would do 11. OK. that she. I want to free solar solar that like would that be possible or would that only be possible?
Speaker 1:
It wouldn't matter what you do, you can do that with the free program. Alright I think I just sent the. See OK, I just sent an updated one without those.
Speaker 2:
Oh, Chris, yeah, this table is so much smaller. Like there's the second one is like. Sure, yeah, it's super sure. That But Could be I
Speaker 1:
Oh, that one I only sent it to
Speaker 2:
you. Let's see
Speaker 1:
Yeah, uh, I sent it to the end.
Speaker 2:
Yeah So And Oh, it's for sure.
Speaker 1:
I'd say that would be typical. I mean, 3 to 4 months is definitely impossible. So like January, like February, March, April, May, so maybe like April, May, it's like really quick. Cause I.
Speaker 2:
Yeah,
Speaker 1:
that's, that's usually been more standard, like it's usually just like.
Speaker 2:
OK The way you were getting. It Right Or. OK.
Speaker 1:
Um I calculated it off the kilowatt-hour production,
Speaker 2:
so it's
Speaker 1:
15,700 kilowatt hours, and it's 18.59. Which the watt hour rate in DC.
Speaker 2:
I, I sent you. The lower unit and the upper unit,
Speaker 1:
right? Yeah, I believe so yeah. From your calculating Yes, so like at my screen right now, I'm looking at like the maximum. And we would just like, you know, you can just kind of arbitrarily draw a line and say, hey, these panels are apart for this one, these panels are for the other.
Speaker 2:
OK.
Speaker 1:
It would be, um, that's just like a really conservative like model too like it's like from 1970 to 2000. I just ran it with a more updated one. It looks like you're down like 22%. Overproduction, so that's like the, like, hey, if you're trying to maximize the um savings, I guess you could split it, it's only
Speaker 2:
22%,
Speaker 1:
so
Speaker 2:
it's
Speaker 1:
not like a huge um difference.
Speaker 2:
So there is Yes, installer will not publicly use or display any unless you initial the space or do I have the initial. Um I think you We,
Speaker 1:
that's just like if we put it on our website. Um, We don't really update like new pictures, but I don't think you would have to know.
Speaker 2:
So.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, that I'll probably have to resend it without that.
Speaker 2:
OK, done. OK, let me. Yeah I But is Uh Perfect
Speaker 1:
All right, that just sent that.
Speaker 2:
She was Or
Speaker 1:
I edit or I edited it on the last one that I signed, so I don't know if my dal
Speaker 2:
sign, but. That Oh thank you Oh I
Speaker 1:
OK, great, um, while I got you here I can look at. Calendar for the inspection. Do you know when you're gonna be back in town?
Speaker 2:
I will be back in mid February and my wife will be back later but. The I I will be back at work and then I'll see. Yeah
Speaker 1:
We can do sometime that week.
Speaker 2:
Does that work?
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I would 9 a.m. work?
Speaker 2:
Yeah OK, great. So we do we do 10 a.m. Um
Speaker 1:
We do uh time slots of 9, 11, 1 and 2, so I couldn't put it specifically on 10, um, but it's like a 30-40 minute expansion.
Speaker 2:
OK. Yeah. This
Speaker 1:
I think you cut out there.
Speaker 2:
What
Speaker 1:
was the last thing you
Speaker 2:
said? I'm just I Uh, the weapon.
Speaker 1:
On the 1?
Speaker 2:
Is
Speaker 1:
Cool, I'm gonna put your name down on the site survey form, and it'll send a text and an email in just a moment. And if anything changes or something comes up, uh, just let me know and I'll get a different, you have a calendar.
Speaker 2:
Um And It's got to. Uh, like that. 563. You guys Yeah. But for us. Yeah, yeah, like. I 5 more. Yeah.
Speaker 1:
And yeah, we, we do that all the time. Like we, we have people switch it over. Like I have one guy switched it over like day before install because like the other like 4 neighbors around him just bought it too, so like, um, it's obviously it's easier if we do that, like decide sooner or later, but I can come back with like the final design and everything and, um, in case like the number of panels or the production changes.
Speaker 2:
design it so that it would optimize for covering piles from both places.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I can truly do that, and I'm putting a note down to to look into like what the updated numbers would be for the SA, cause the um spreadsheets I sent were like more, that'd be a little outdated.
Speaker 2:
I remember thinking that like.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, it was like it was
Speaker 2:
like.
Speaker 1:
Higher, wasn't
Speaker 2:
it? Yeah No. I, I.
Speaker 1:
Interesting, yeah, if you wanna send me the updated and updated bill, I can take a look at that and also get the updated letters for you. Awesome, thanks so much, Andrew.
Speaker 2:
Thank you very much.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, bye now.
Speaker 2:
You know.
Speaker 1:
Sorry.
Speaker 2:
If I'm a better. Yeah I kind of figured out like. I Yeah I say that or that. Um. OK From that
