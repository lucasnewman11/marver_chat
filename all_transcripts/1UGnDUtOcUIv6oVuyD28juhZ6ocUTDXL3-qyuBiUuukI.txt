Speaker 1:
Can you explain to me how this like how the tax credit works and why exactly this is? Yeah, exactly. The tax, the tax credit is one of two incentives, and that's a federal one anywhere in the country that you do this, that you'll usually get about 30% back on yours. So you have tax liability, but pretty much everyone gets it. OK. What makes it free is the DC incentive. So do you know the uh Clean Energy Act they passed in like 2018? Yeah, so it mandated that 100% of our power in the district has to come from renewable sources by like, yeah, eight years from now. Not only that, all the power, renewable power has to be produced within the district. Yeah, so PEA would love to go and, you know, just build massive solar. they they have to get it some way, but they don't own like land here. There's not like, you know, huge fields to like put this up. So pretty much everyone's roof space just became prime real estate and it's cheaper for Pepco to help pay for your solar than to pay the fines that they have to pay. OK. So when we do free solar, uh, an investor, it's like private equity, local government partnerships we have, they'll put up like the 34 $40,000 to put the system on your house because they're gonna make all their money back and like. 5 years or so and it's like you can do that too, um, but like not everyone has 400 line around and financing is like 11% interest right now. So most people just do the free because it's super easy. You just send in an application and all the power is free if you make more power than you need, they just pay for it. Got it. OK, interesting. And so who are the, who are the folks that are putting up, what, what, what are the public private partnerships that are putting up the money? Yeah, yeah, there's like kind of two groups, so there's the installers, which there's like a million of them in DC. So where we come in, my company is Sustainable You. We started in 2019 and because there's so many installers here, it's kind of hard to know, you know, what you're gonna get kind of like the union market, you can go to a different installer every single day and get a different quote and like different, you know, warranties are different coverage are different. So we just started doing insults through everyone then to see who's the best because we wanna make this super easy for people so you don't have to spend like a year talking to a million different companies to figure out what's gonna be best for you. So most of our insoles go through solar solution. That's the uh main insular. They've done like 6000 projects here. They're super reliable. You'll see their signs everywhere, uh, some of your neighbors really, um, on your street to them. And there's like two main investors in DC, Posien and Red Bull, and yeah, they just give the money to the installer. The installer is the project and then uh a lot of those incentives end up going back to the investor. Got it. OK, interesting. Yeah, that kind of make sense? Yeah, yeah. OK, cool. I try not to
Speaker 2:
neighbors were part of that like. Group that did the reverse option and that bids for like I don't.
Speaker 1:
I didn't know
Speaker 2:
it was
Speaker 1:
a DOE.
Speaker 2:
I don't think it was DOE. I think it was a private company that was like, I'm wondering why do like a group install for like whoever signs up.
Speaker 1:
I'm wondering why
Speaker 2:
they just didn't do this.
Speaker 1:
Maybe because like the benefits accrue the cash accrues to them, they do it themselves. Uh, yeah, if you buy it, you get the incentives. Yeah, if that's the program I think it is, or I know at least like the DOE one or some others I've seen that are kind of set up like that. They really only do the purchase option because, uh, what they do. It's like a bundle install and then they ins they'll just like bid that out and say like, hey, who wants to do this like for the cheapest and they just whoever get wins the contract, they do those, you know, like 20-30 installs that uh people reach out for but they usually only offer the uh purchase one for that. OK. OK. And that's where like, yeah, some companies don't do the free programs. Some are like way more expensive and that's sort of like hey we have, you know, access to all the programs uh you get a lot of leverage because kind of like the bundle install it's like we're grouping this project and like 60, 70 others a month and then bringing most of those to like solar solution or the other installers. So that's how we're able to get like a lot of special things done and Uh, it does help like, you know, all the installers are pretty good, but they're big companies and it's like working with contractors and construction. So it's always good to have a second, uh, set of eyes on this, just making sure it's progressing and that's where, um, not only before install but like for the lifetime system. I'm your personal representative, uh, to, for all this, I'm the best point of contact and, uh, yeah, we're gonna get it done for you.
Speaker 2:
Great, cool,
Speaker 1:
yeah. And uh how do you get your electric bill? Do you get like uh like a paper one? Do you check
Speaker 2:
it online? Oh, OK,
Speaker 1:
yeah. So you just pull it up on your phone. Yeah, OK. If, uh, if you could pull up like,
Speaker 2:
OK.
Speaker 1:
And then I uh I'll plug in the usage and then we'll see what it's uh doing for you. Have you ever looked into this before, uh, talking to my neighbors. So we've got um some literature about. Actually, let me just pull up what the who the installer was. Um, and most people's like mailboxes and. Uh, like they're getting texts and calls, solar switch. Oh yeah, yeah. So what is the difference between that programming? So that one it was like you will pay for the install. Yeah, that's what I was talking about. It is pretty cool. The, so the DOE, they have like a partnership with this Dutch company that runs the whole thing and then they like manage all of it and then they get all these people like, hey, we're interested in solar, and then it's like pay 23 people they'll put that out to some of the installers. Mhm. Like, hey, like who wants to do this, and then you get the benefit of a lower price. Got it, got it, got it, yeah, for the purchase option, it's like a really good way to go, um, because sometimes it's like even cheaper than what we can offer. Yeah. So once we, if we get solar panels on our roof, like they are owned by the installers through the perpetuity, right? What ramifications does that have for like selling the house, for example? Great question. These are set up as a PPA, which is a power purchase agreement, and it's the same thing you have with PEPCO, and a power purchase agreement is like, hey, I'm agreeing to purchase your power for well with PEPCO. It's like whatever rate they say, so like 16 cents go what. OK. This is a PPA with the system where you're purchasing all the power. For 0 cents and then that rate never changes. OK. And uh it's cool too, even though you don't like own the actual panels, uh, you own all the power that's produced, right? So when you send excess power to the grid, if you make more power than use during the year, like a lot of people. You'll get a check, uh, back from Petco at the end of the year, yeah. And then when you're like when you're like selling the house, for example, do you know how that's like listed? Oh yeah, I'm sorry, that was gonna be a question. Uh, when you go to switch, uh, you could just give me or anyone that's assemble you a call. We'll get in touch with your realtor or the new homeowner. They'll put their name on like a half page form. And all the warranties, all the free power, everything transfers over to them. Yeah, it's pretty, pretty painless. And then if there's like maintenance, ongoing maintenance with the with the panels and stuff like this, the um installer take care of that on those basis. Yeah, pretty much just don't get up on your roof and start bashing it with a hammer and, uh, yeah, and there's two things that could like, I guess like everyone's like, hey, we can. One is like, uh, like act of God, like if a tree falls on it or if there's a hurricane or something like that, that's all covered. And then the other thing is like, let's say, you know, like detective panel or like maybe like You know, hey, like year 8, the, the inverter thought they're responsible for all that, and it's pretty cool too. It's all, uh, monitored so you can get in and out on your phone and then see what each panel is doing. If something goes wrong, you'll get notified. We have access to that too, so usually it's like they'd be calling you and saying, hey, like we know Sha and went out. Can we, you know, come out next Friday and fix it for you? OK, yeah, OK, cool. And they're, they're making money off of it too, so like if it went down, um, because they're getting paid on the power that's made, they have a financial incentive to come out here and fix it for you, so. And uh it's all in line with uh like with the Clean Energy Act. um, it, it mandates like what kind of equipment can go towards uh hitting the energy target so like they can only install like tier one equipment on any part of it. So it's like they got to put good equipment up there. It's gonna last a long time.
Speaker 2:
So they're gonna just like maximize like maximize the roof space. Like they'll put not the number of panels needed to like power this home, but like. As much as they can put so they can like sell that
Speaker 1:
OK yeah and it's up to you like if you just wanna do like a smaller system that's totally fine or if you want to do one that like just um covers your bill, that's up to you but it like it kind of it benefits you the most to to fill up the most space because you get the most savings or the bigger check from Paco at the end of the year. So it's like you can kind of do whatever you want, but um. Yeah, pretty much everyone maxes it out. Is that the bill
Speaker 2:
right there? Yeah, OK, the phone was, yeah,
Speaker 1:
if you go to view bill details under the 109. And then if you go to download PDF. And on the 3rd page there. Um, that chart right there. And I'm gonna. Put all those numbers on like the horizontal chart uh into these months here and then I can see what it's doing in the system, but Your usage looks really good. Like anything under 1000 is great. Kiber hours. Yep. Dollars too. All right, January. I Are April It's pretty interesting how much more
Speaker 2:
like
Speaker 1:
energy usage there
Speaker 2:
is for AC than to feat. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
true. Is it electric heat here? Do you have like a heat pump?
Speaker 2:
There's no heat pump on.
Speaker 1:
Probably flips with the gas bill in the winter then. Mhm. Yeah, just as long as you don't use like space heaters, those are. Those will make your usage like higher in the winter. For sure. I Some Awesome. Great. All right. I make sure Stimulation is get a little bit. All right, this is about what we're working with for space. Um, obviously can't put anything else where there's like the H vacuum and stuff. Do you know if there's been any like changes to the roof since this was taken in June? OK, awesome. OK,
Speaker 2:
cool, like this past June, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1:
So this would be 23 panels, and it'll produce 11,000 kilowatt hours of energy, which you're using like 6400. So You'll get your not only your bill covered for the whole year, which like 6000. So in the past year, you probably spent about. To It's like about 1000. So not only would you say the $1000 of power, but you're gonna send. 267. You sign an extra 4800 to the grid. They pay you back at 12 cents. So you'll save 1000 on the bill, and then you'll get a check from PEPCO at the end of the year for like 500 $600. So you'll still get that statement from PEPCO. But what it's gonna look like. Mm. It is more like this. Oh, like on the negative. Yeah. So for yours, like all you're overproducing every month. So these would go negative and then you'll have the balance accrue throughout the year. And then each month that you're adding to that, it'll be about 50 to $600 at the end of the year, and then they'll just send you a check with the, in the mail with the last statement, and then it resets every January. Yeah. And then, yeah, that's uh that's pretty much it, um. All, uh, all this is we would submit an application and I have to like read like uh each part of it so it kind of answers a lot of the same questions we just went over but you just send that in and then they'll give you a call next week to set up the site survey and then they'll check out the roof, they'll look at your breaker panel. It's a, it's, it's a newer house I would imagine like um. When you moved on, was like a lot of stuff replaced or yeah,
Speaker 2:
yeah, 2018 2019 yeah it was like gutted and like completely redone, yeah,
Speaker 1:
yeah. So it, these phones are really easy because a lot of the stuff's near the roof looks pretty good. And then after we get the site survey back, then we'll send it in to PEPCO for approval and then we'll talk to the DOB, get permits, and then after all that comes back, you'll be installed ready. Instal takes about a day and then after Pepco turns it on a couple of weeks after that, you'll start seeing it on your bill. I would say it's really November, like November, December. I'd say like uh maybe January or February, um, is when you get installed and then after that, um, great time to. Um, have your system turned on because you'll have it on before the summer, which is when your highest pulse are, right, right, yeah, OK, yeah. Would it help to look at it like, do you want to see what the application looks like, or, yeah, sure, alright sweet and while you pull that up, like and perhaps do technical questions, but like, OK, so the solar panels are, you know, harvesting over a day, but there's like obviously. Like when you're out of the house and there's no energy utilization, like where is it being stored? Oh, yeah, like at nighttime. Yeah, great question. There and you probably mean like a like a battery system. So with these, it's not necessary to have batteries because when you send extra kilowatt-hour to the grid, you're getting credited for that. Oh, it's automatically OK yeah, like that, um. Like that balance that you build up like or like let's say. For. Let's say your system gets turned on like end of February, so like March is your first full month. You're gonna use like 500. I know it's kind of small, but you're gonna use like 571 and then it's gonna make like 400 more kilowatt hours than than that. That 400 extra kilowatt hours, it essentially goes in like a like a like an energy bank or something. They'll keep track of it and then like at that time when you know you'll still draw power from the grid, but since your meter's been, you know, running back all day, you won't have to, it'll draw from that before it draws from your bank account you got it,
Speaker 2:
got it, yeah. OK. So there's never a scenario where we would need to revert back to non-solar in the event of like, I don't know, it breaks and like we can't have power, like what would Or, or we like let's say we randomly start using like way more energy than we have been and yeah like what happens in that scenario like more than like the panels are able to keep up with our energy usage.
Speaker 1:
So what this will do is constant and then like, but you're right, like your, your energy usage usage could change if you get like an electric car or if you have like 5 people moving or something. So the 11,000 kilowatt hours it makes, that's gonna stay the same and you're just gonna get your 1st 11,000 kilowatt hours for free. If you use more than that, it's just built at whatever PEPCO's rate is.
Speaker 2:
Got you. OK.
Speaker 1:
You're still connected to the grid. OK. Or like
Speaker 2:
if they all break and so whatever, somebody can't come out to fix them and yeah, like what happens in that scenario
Speaker 1:
still connected to the grid. So Pepco is like your backup. OK, yeah, and then a pep goes down like uh if there's a power outage, you're still kind of out of luck for. I mean if you want to spend like 3000 on batteries, uh, I could show you some, you know,
Speaker 2:
really
Speaker 1:
expensive
Speaker 2:
batteries, but
Speaker 1:
yeah, and that that's why, you know, I've, I've never done batteries for anyone here because it like sometimes it's more expensive than like actually purchasing the system, so. I think, you know, in I think like next 3 to 5 years um biotechnology is gonna get a lot better. That's where they're putting a lot of money right now and like I imagine a lot of people will get batteries in like a couple of years from now and it's like, hey, you can just pay like 500 bucks and like, you know. OK. And then it's uh your name is A N I R U D H O H at the. Oh, OK, you got it all. Nice. And then what's your last name? S R
Speaker 2:
I R A N as in Nancy, G A M as in Mary.
Speaker 1:
Yeah Oh,
Speaker 2:
I'm
Speaker 1:
gonna try See, it's gotta match the city records to. So
Speaker 2:
Um
Speaker 1:
4:15.
Speaker 2:
314, 15. 0,
Speaker 1:
gotcha. Oh, what did I say 1514?
Speaker 2:
I think I said 15st Virginia.
Speaker 1:
OK, cool. just has your initial middle initial there's my middle initial? I don't know it? Maybe they just like added one that P in there.
Speaker 2:
A a a maybe I spaced out.
Speaker 1:
Is there, is there a key on the bill?
Speaker 2:
The bill's actually under my, the PEPCO bill is under my name. So I don't think your name even appears anywhere on here. Yeah, it's just my name.
Speaker 1:
Interesting, OK. And first name. last name.
Speaker 2:
I know.
Speaker 1:
I R
Speaker 2:
A N G A
Speaker 1:
M. And what's the best number for you? 449. 2391. Cool Uh And then this is gonna send a copy to your email and it's gonna text it to you too. And I'm just gonna put the address on there. Bless you. Thank you. Oh All right. Just send that to you. Pull it up so I can show it. Uh All right. And then on this, uh, has you put like a bunch of initials on each part of it. They're pretty thorough, um, with it because it is a construction project, but the first page, it's like, uh, once we survey it and, uh, confirm the system size and everything, they'll fill all that on it and send a completed copy back to you, but the, uh, rate is $0 for the electric. And then it'll have your information on there. Uh, we're gonna obviously design install, maintain, and operate the system, and it's all warrantied, all that stuff. Uh, you're gonna pay the monthly payment each month, which, uh, when I go down there, it's gonna say monthly payment $0. And then, uh, if you move, uh, like I said, uh, you can transfer it, you know, you could buy it and or you could pay to have it removed, um, at like year 6, you could buy it too if you're gonna be in the house for a long time. A lot of options. Most people are just gonna do, um, it's a 20 year term and then it extends for another 3, another 10, so it's 30 years and then after 30 years it's not really gonna be worth anything and you can just own it at that point, yeah. Uh yeah, that's what I said too, you can uh renew it for up to 10 more years. You could buy it at that point, or you could do some kind of a new agreement or something like that, or at 20 years if you wanted to take it off, we'll take it off for for free. So if we, like, let's say before that 6th anniversary, we sell this home, the next owner, their only obligation is to continue to pay there. The utilities, they have no other obligations to the installer to yeah or they'd be obligated to pay the $0.00 for the electric yeah. And is there like is there any chance of that that monthly payment amount would like sunset and there would be like it would change yeah it never changes and let me show you that. So on those agreements. So this is the rate schedule that you're agreeing to and they'll put the kilowatt hours on there after they confirm the production, but it's $0.00 per kilowatt hour each of the 20 years. Yeah, OK, great, cool. And obviously because of the $0 we're gonna guarantee you'll save money the first year. And Uh, gotta keep your home and like roofing good condition and like don't leave the trash bags or I guess on your roof or something like that. And then, uh, these are like all the things that have the initial like, uh, hey, we got access to your property to do like we're running work on your home and like get on your roof and stuff. Um, if there's anything that is going to affect your ability to pay $0 for this, then I guess, like, let me know. Uh, you're not responsible for, there's no, uh, like personal property taxes on this. And again, if you maybe you can transfer, buy it, or, uh, pay to remove it. Uh, if you need to remove this system for work on your home, uh, we'll remove it and reinstall it for a fee. And
Speaker 2:
that was gonna be my next question actually like maintenance and upkeep like. I don't know if that's possible with a bunch of panels up there. Oh yeah, so they have to come off in order to like redo the roof in like whatever 10 years, yeah,
Speaker 1:
OK, and it'll definitely happen at some point like the warranty on the panels like year 30, they'll be, they'll be 90% output as they are on year one. So like they, they might be up there longer than or like they might be viable like longer than I'm here. Yeah, so you'll definitely get your roof replaced in that time. When that happens, like, uh, if it's like, hey, like, you know, 1015, 20 years from now, it's like, hey, like time to get a new roof, we'll come out, we'll take them off, we'll put the new roof on, then we'll, uh, reinstall them. Well, there is a fee, uh, because we have roofing partners like one of our solar installers. Uh, they've been a roofer for like 50 years. You get a good deal on the roof, so a lot of times it kind of evens out where it's like, hey, you pay a fee to remove the panels, but you're getting a good deal on the roof. So it usually doesn't end up being more expensive and then it's like, you know, you're saving 1500 to 600 bucks a year anyway, so. And Uh, if you don't, uh, if you feel able to pay the $0 then like, they're gonna, you know, get like a late late or like default payment from you, but, um, there's, you can't really default on it if there's no payment and we're not gonna ever ask you for any, uh, like you don't have to put in like a bank account or like a card information at all. And then, uh, when we do this, like we're obviously gonna pay like the surveyors and stuff, we're gonna uh do all the permitting on your behalf and like we're gonna do all the things for PEPCO, it's not like for you to do all that. If it's like, you know, we're getting towards ins already and you guys wake up and you're like, hey, I hate solar one day, that's fine. Um, do, I wouldn't wait till like, you know, that long to Like, uh, say, hey, like, never mind, I don't want to do it anymore, uh, because they'll, you know, come back for you for, uh, just so they didn't break even on like paying all those costs. So you wanna make sure you're excited about going on solar and then it makes sense for you, um, but yeah, if you, if you wait like till we've like spend all that money to get this project through all the permitting and stuff, then they'll like ask for that money back from you. And Um, if you want to take us to court, you can, uh, after a small claims court, uh, it'll go to like arbitration. Uh, usually try to, um, I have never got involved with that, but that's the whole point of this to make it a good experience for you. And then obviously we're gonna give like your address to like you know PEPCO they already have it and like to have the inspector come out like site serving everything. And then that one's optional. Um, if this was one where there was a payment on it, they would do a credit, uh, check on you, but we're not gonna collect, um, enough information to, uh, it'll still have your initial this one, but we're just collecting your Pepco bill and can't really check your credit with that. We don't need your social or anything. And then this one's electronic disclosure that just lets us send this all through email and stuff versus uh doing like a paper one. And then they have you sign at the bottom. And this is all like the disclosures, um, like this is the one for the charges, so. Uh, 20 years, 240 months, uh, total cost of this will be $0 for you, your monthly payments are $0 your total of all those payments is $0 your monthly payments is $0 and the total again is $0. And acknowledging that you got that. This is where we'll upload the design after we confirm it. If you wanna cancel the form that already here for you. Uh, state disclosures, uh, obviously you have a right to cancel. And you got that. This is the interconnection agreement that we send to PEPCO. It has, we have you fill out like everything, uh, when you submit it so that we don't have to keep coming back to you for paperwork. And that one lets you connect to the grid. And we're gonna put all this stuff on for you. You don't need to fill it all out. And Then after the PAPO one, this is for the DOB we're gonna do permits. I'm saying like hey I um the property. Um, there you put it there too. Then this is the uh for the inspection after it's installed. And then the last form is the PJM form, and this is what assigns the uh incentives to uh the installer and the investor group. So they can pay for it and then that's it. OK. Yeah, sounds good. And if it looks good, um, then, yeah, uh, you can fill it out on, it just has to be on your, they just make us state on your device. So either your laptop or your phone. And then once that's completed, then, uh, they'll give you a call to schedule the survey and yeah, we'll get the ball rolling for you. Great. How long does the install itself take? It's about a day. OK. Some, sometimes they'll break it up and they'll do, maybe they'll do like set up on day one, they'll put the inverter on on day one and then um. Yeah, pretty much all our installs are are one day. OK, cool. And then when it gets to be that time, then I'll usually give you a call or you send from Solar Solution. I'll give you a call and be like, Hey, here's our availability, you know, we'll find a day that works for you. And uh there's only 3 total days you have to be here. Uh, the first day is is today, so thanks for being here. And then uh. Uh, next one's for the site survey. They'll have to come in and check your electric electric box and then the last day is the install. They'll have to work in the electric box again and on your roof and stuff, but, um, you don't have to be like, you know, block off your calendar for 24 hours as long as they can get in, um, then yeah, it'll be good. OK,
Speaker 2:
that
Speaker 1:
sounds
Speaker 2:
great.
Speaker 1:
Yeah. Is there, is there anything, any other questions, anything I can help you out with?
Speaker 2:
No, I think. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
OK, cool. Um, did you wanna like wait, um, to submit it or like look at the application more? Can we, can we just like, yeah, yeah, do your, do your due diligence. Uh, let me know if, uh, like you can access that document as much as you want and then. Uh, yeah, once, uh, you feel good on it and it looks good, then yeah, we, we'll send it in here. Great. Sounds great. Cool. I'll get it whenever, uh, you're done with it. I'll get like a notification, and then as soon as I get that, I'll let, uh, Solar solution know and then they'll be in touch pretty quick to schedule the survey. Excellent. Awesome awesome, sweet. Well yeah, if there's, uh, is there anything else I can do for you?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, PEPCO will be, it doesn't have to be my name on the application if my name is on the account with PEPCO, right?
Speaker 1:
Or, yeah,
Speaker 2:
OK, just the address has to match.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, OK. There is like a, there is like a separate form, uh, that we send in if the, uh, bill, the name on the bill doesn't. Match the um like whoever the application is for but you don't need to, uh, it's nothing you need to sign or anything. It's like, hey, these people both live here OK sounds good. Yeah, cool, cool. Here's my card. And then yeah, please let me know if you have any questions and Yeah, hope to, hope we can get this one. Thank you. Do anything, uh,
