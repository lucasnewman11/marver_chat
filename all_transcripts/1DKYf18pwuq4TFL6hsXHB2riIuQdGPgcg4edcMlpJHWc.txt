Speaker 1:
We need to see like I. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
Uh So For. But I put this graph click on it on the 3rd page and then I can plug those numbers into the design. Can you remind me your address?
Speaker 1:
441. Now Northeast.
Speaker 2:
Uh, take your time. That And all she had and and all that stuff, um. But yeah, so this is an Aurora. I just go in and from that graph I put them. And all these bits here and then it'll like immediately plug it into the design and.
Speaker 1:
Mhm
Speaker 2:
And when you looked at it uh last time, do you, were you looking into buying it or doing one of the free programs or? Buying, I think, because if it was more than like 2 or so years ago, that was pretty much the only way you could do it.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I think it was probably around that time. Thank you. So
Speaker 2:
I mean the
Speaker 1:
old
Speaker 2:
phone. I know it's OK.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, it's not Sounds good, you
Speaker 2:
could uh. Email it to me and I'll just like pull it up um. My email is on the card. Yeah it'll be a lot easier. Um, and that's like the most common situation I've ran into. Most people, they've heard about like solar in DC cause like so many people have it. Um, but a lot of people looked didn't do it like 2 or 3 years ago, and it's like, hey, you can pay like $3000 to go solar, or like take out a loan, and like, most people were like, oh hey, I don't really want to do that right now. And uh just decided they were never going to go solar. Um, and then we come in like 2 or 3 years ago and start doing the free program, and that's pretty much, uh, what all our signups are, is with the free one, cause you pay nothing for it and all the power is free.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I guess the one I was looking into a friend had recommended that. Um I think you pay part, they pay part, and then you get like if you're getting into the system, then you get money every month, so that seemed like a pretty good system.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, Solar So used to have a, a, uh, that's one of the installer we were partnered with. They had a really good program um like that where it was like I feel like that was like the step in between the free solar and the like fully buying it. So it's like it was much more of like a feasible out of pocket for folks and it's like, yeah, worked out. Thank you so much. And I'm just gonna enter those in. It looks like other than summertime, it goes pretty well.
Speaker 1:
Yeah.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, yeah, anything I do like 7-800 um for months other than the summer is good and you're like. 300 for couple of years.
Speaker 1:
Um Um Mm. OK um.
Speaker 2:
He's like double the electric keys last January. We're uh used to like double the electric you did last January. Do you think yeah I think it was a lot colder. Do you have electric heat? Yeah.
Speaker 1:
Oh
Speaker 2:
wow, that's like still really good usage for electric heat.
Speaker 1:
I keep it very. I wear a sweater, but I also, my thing is here, so it gets really hot upstairs if I have it on too.
Speaker 2:
Oh, got you. Well that's even better because most people don't have electric heat, and it's like their winter bill will look just like their summer bill, and it's like way less common to cover all the usage.
Speaker 1:
Yeah. Mm.
Speaker 2:
OK, great.
Speaker 1:
And
Speaker 2:
So like that So just about 9600 kilowatt hours last year. If you, if you had to guess what you paid for all your electric last year, what do you think, uh, you spent?
Speaker 1:
I think on average my bill is like $70 or $80 a month. Would get a little higher in the summer and on the cold months and then lower on. OK,
Speaker 2:
so let's do, if it's 9600. Electric rate right now is 18.59 cents. It started more as more around like 15 cents last year, so it did go up a little bit. Um, so, even if I figure like a 16 cents rate, that and the odd hours, that 15 cents is like $1500. Or Like $130 a month. If you had this program already last year, what do you think you would have sent?
Speaker 1:
Yeah.
Speaker 2:
Oh, you're good, you're good. So. It would be
Speaker 1:
OK. Mhm.
Speaker 2:
So, if you would have had this last year, your average electric bill would, uh, instead of being like $130 it would have been like $24. And that's pretty much it. There's no cost. You get all the power for free. It covers, it'll cover about like 85% of your usage. There's like a little bit more limited space, cause we can put a couple panels on that side, but it's like the south, and it's like facing away, so it's like not a ton. If you could load up both sides, that's like the ideal, um, but you do have like perfect southern exposure there, so you can do most of it like that, get a couple panels on the back, and then. It's covering most of your bill and it's like you. Like yearly savings would be if it's like 8000 kilowatt hours it's making. Yeah, it'd save you about like $1500 a year, and you don't have to pay for it, and that's uh pretty much it.
Speaker 1:
And then what's the. If something happens to my roof because of the solar panel that's covered or?
Speaker 2:
Good question. Yeah, anything that could happen, uh, you're, since you're paying nothing for it, they take full liability, um, unless like you're like purposely breaking it yourself. Like don't get on your roof and start smashing them, um, but the two categories of things that could go wrong is like an act of God, like if a tree falls on it and breaks it, or like a bad hail storm comes through, they're on the hook to fix all that, and then if the
Speaker 1:
roof.
Speaker 2:
Like. If a tree falls on it and like let's say it like breaks, like, let's say there's like no solar panels on this side and there's solar panels on this side, and it like somehow breaks the panels on this side and also breaks this portion of the roof that like let's say we didn't put panels there that we did. Touch it probably also deal with your homeowner's insurance would cover that, but it's like anything like the roof warranty we give you, if you get like a roof leak, for example, at some point, we have to come out and check it because we did work on your roof. If we determine that it was because of the solar, then we're on hook to fix it. But if it was like completely unrelated to the solar, it would be just how you would normally do it like if you had a roof leak in your house today.
Speaker 1:
OK. I think I wanna do a little bit more research, but
Speaker 2:
you probably should, yeah, and that that's exactly why I'm here, um, what's like, um. I like the most important thing for you to get out of it.
Speaker 1:
I mean, I, I like the environmental benefits. Cost to my electricity. There you go. Yeah. Yeah, um, yeah, so I, I'm very interested, uh, I, I do wanna look into it a little bit more if I do move forward, what's the next step?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, you just, uh, submit a zero cent rate form to, uh, we send everything to PEPCO and we take a picture of your electric bill, and then we'll do an inspection, so we'll like take a bunch of pictures and measurements of your roof, we'll check out your main panel, and once we have the engine. We'll send that into PEPCO too and uh we're really looking for PEPCO approval to install cause this could look really good, but it's all on them. They can, they like randomly disqualify projects and like say you can't do it. There's also like No real guarantee that this will be available, like, um, that's why everyone's getting their applications in now because like your like lock in is when you're installed, and that's typically like 3 to 4 months. But if PEPCO throws a wrench in it like they do, like I had a project signed up in March last year and it just got installed in December. If these incentives go away before then, then they wouldn't install on your roof and you it's like, hey, at least we tried. Um, so even like my purchase clients, like only about 5% of people I work with actually do the purchase option. We still submit it as a free project because it's like, you don't wanna sign a purchase contract or sign up for a loan and then like have everything change, right? So that's why the free one's so good, cause you take your risk, and if it's still around when it comes around to install time, then you're good to go.
Speaker 1:
Yeah,
Speaker 2:
that's pretty much it. Yeah, it's, it's, uh, our whole job is to just make it as easy and boring as possible. Did you look into our company at all?
Speaker 1:
I have not yet. It's been a little hectic the last couple of weeks.
Speaker 2:
00, is, is your job safe?
Speaker 1:
I think I should be
Speaker 2:
OK.
Speaker 1:
Oh good.
Speaker 2:
OK.
Speaker 1:
Oh, that's right,
Speaker 2:
yeah, what, um, you might have more insight into some things going on than I do, um.
Speaker 1:
I mean, our secretary gets confirmed next week, so we'll see what happens after that um I don't imagine. Clean energy incentives are gonna be high on their list, but there's also a lot of business benefits, so I, yeah, we'll have to see what happens. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
it's
Speaker 1:
hard
Speaker 2:
to imagine that solar in particular will be in
Speaker 1:
the
Speaker 2:
crosshairs
Speaker 1:
because of the whole. The profile of it economically. I think Trump doesn't like wind specifically. He really hates my. Again, I don't work on the energy side. I work on the like nuclear side of the building, but, um, nuclear weapons side of the building, not energy, um, but yeah, so. right That's uh, um,
Speaker 2:
does the Secretary of Energy, the is that the right title or oh do they have like a lot of control over over things or a lot of leverage?
Speaker 1:
Yes, uh, yeah, they usually make the kind of key decisions about the budget and where the priority focus is going to be, I think given Trump's interest in getting rid of certain things, I think that will probably impact how they make those decisions, but um. Usually it's, it's at the secretarial level that they kind of decide their priorities based on. Yeah Got you.
Speaker 2:
Yeah,
Speaker 1:
if
Speaker 2:
I
Speaker 1:
can ask what capabilities related to nuclear weapons are
Speaker 2:
under energy rather than the.
Speaker 1:
Uh, so the National Nuclear Security Administration is a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy, and so what NNSA does is we manage the nuclear weapons stockpile, so we have the scientists and technical experts that keep the nuclear weapons functioning, yeah, and then DOD uses them, but we maintain them. And then we also do what I work in is nuclear nonproliferation, so we go out and if there's nuclear or radiological material, making sure that that's secure and people can't get to it, um. So like a more technical civilian kind of capability that complements. What might be a military perspective on our liberation, you have to signific to go out and manage contains equipment, yeah, yeah, so there's different, uh, department of state does some things as well, as does. You know, we, but we do a lot of the very specific, you know, we radiological nonproliferation. Negotiating 23 rooms Yeah It was Yes,
Speaker 2:
important stuff, yeah, no, I mean,
Speaker 1:
yeah, I, I can see why, um, that might
Speaker 2:
be less
Speaker 1:
in the process with the administration change. What would hope yeah, our, our mission is, it's nuclear security, so it's again, there will be some priority shift. But I think we're we're generally pretty safe. It's the energy side again. But. The Department of Energy rightfully so, um, that will have to be again I think there will likely be a refocus on more fossil fuels, but. Business case to make for a lot of. We probably not clean. Oh yeah,
Speaker 2:
uh, where, uh, future energy. No innovation. It, it'll be something more glorifying than the, the volant party probably.
Speaker 1:
American genius. it used to be all of the above. Uh-huh, I think it was under Bush. That's I prefer not to disclose or like. We do everything. It makes America great. Uh, but again, more of a focus on the, the LNG side and the fossil side and probably slightly less money going to the energy and the energy incentives and Yeah, officers in energy who are responsible for, uh, sort of funding research and, and I don't, I, my lack of, um, fine tuned facility with government contracting terms is gonna get up in a second here, but people who are focused on providing public support to win for sure. It Yeah. we are I don't think there's gonna be again more more of a focus like more effort going there getting rid of it altogether. I think it's literally that Trump had a golf course and then nearby there was some wind farm development which trucked view or something and from that day. I think it's a wind farm over like oil rigs he, he, he really cares about real estate value and the the it's so funny listening to him talk about the he killed so many birds. It's the one, the one chick in the armor.
Speaker 2:
I'm it over
Speaker 1:
and
Speaker 2:
over again. Well, here I'll show you with,
Speaker 1:
oh,
Speaker 2:
I'll, I'll show you a couple of things, uh, that might help with your research if that's uh helpful. This is. I know the robot what you to do with your. And that's like what this is the radiance, that's what I was saying with the back there, so it's like, you know, if you reach out to some installers, they'll probably like load that up and show you like a like a 14 kilowatt system there or something, but the program has like efficiency requirements if it's like below um. Like 1000 kilowatt hours per kilo of system size, they won't fund it, um, so there's like a lot of variants like and that's kind of what our our business does because there's a lot of really good store companies here, but it's like if you reach out for like 15 different quotes, you know, a bunch of them are gonna be good, but like, oh hey, I wanna go with the one that's like giving me way more panels. Well, they're not gonna get approved for that. Yeah, so we partner with almost every installer in the district. And that's like our, our mission is to make it easy for you is get you a really good company that's gonna do good work on your house. Most of our projects go through Solar Solution, probably the one you got last time, or ROI Construction. R construction we primarily use because they're the only. And N DC doing uh the solar installations and we built out a lot of that side of the company so it's like when I do. These projects say couple up Christopher Walsh. As a pet.
Speaker 1:
Um Oh.
Speaker 2:
My role in this process is. Uh, kind of be the product manager and like make sure this gets done for you the best way possible. When we do the inspection, they're gonna take a crap ton of pictures of everything. Because when we send this in, it's gotta be right if we have like the wrong color zip ties or like. A sticker in the wrong place, then like they're gonna like do everything and that's why like some companies their projects just get like held up for a long time. Um, but we'll check out everything, make sure it's good to go for you, and then it's a lot better to have roofers putting this on your roof than just like solar contractors, and that's what we found is the best way to do it. And there's like a little bit more involvement for, uh, me because I gotta like check all this stuff, but I have a whole team of people, um, like I have my assistant and uh people like stuff for me with a bunch of stuff and like Nicole at the installer and like games and all these other people. Um, and our whole goal is just to like have you like get the infection done and just kind of forget that you ever did it and then a couple months later we'll be coming back to put them on your roof, um, but. Yeah, is there like any Anything else I can help you with because we definitely want to feel good about it.
Speaker 1:
I feel very good about it. Oh yeah, talk to her liking it, um, and then I'll make a decision and do I just send you an email or
Speaker 2:
you can send me an email and like uh what a lot of people do. If it all looks good to you, I'll just send you like a bold sign, and we'll have like, uh, you just like put your initials on it first so we can take a picture of it, put it on our website like I showed you, or, um, and then you sign off on the bottom. We'll set up the inspection date and then you'll be good to go, um, and that's, that's pretty much it. Um, don't have to pay anything for it yeah.
Speaker 1:
You could be Yeah. Cool, yeah, I again, I'm meeting him next week someday, uh, with some other friends, so I just wanna chat with him and then.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, do that, because he's like, hey, we just met. So, um, so I
Speaker 1:
got
Speaker 2:
friends and.
Speaker 1:
Do you what other rad. I don't remember exactly what it was. It was something where you pay a fee, they pay a fee, and then. The, if, if you're doing more than you, your usage, then you get like money every month or something you get like a return on or you get something pack. I don't remember again it's been a couple of years. No What that was, um. Before I make the final decision because
Speaker 2:
theirs is like. I have a quote, it's like solar station. Uh See if it's on this one. my phone. The association quote and uh contract amount tax credit. I think they also put. That might be option one and they have options. Yeah, that's the one for the free. I'm just showing him a quote of what you're talking.
Speaker 1:
That's It's
Speaker 2:
I'll take the foot down. Oh, I have to find it out,
Speaker 1:
yeah. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
um,
Speaker 1:
and other. It sounds like you went with solar solution.
Speaker 2:
They're like, you know, if you
Speaker 1:
had
Speaker 2:
a
Speaker 1:
really
Speaker 2:
good experience
Speaker 1:
with them
Speaker 2:
and like that's like an installer you trust because he had a good experience with them, we can totally put it through solar solution, um, or any of the other installers. There's just a couple I like wouldn't touch,
Speaker 1:
but uh whatever uh. What however you wanna get it done, we'll get it done for you, um, sure. No, it's OK. It's in the middle of. Yeah, thanks for your time. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
you got my card and then um feel free to give me like a call, text or email, and um if it could help to if you have some more questions, uh, just give me a call and we'll figure it out for you. Thanks so much, Julie. Bye bye bye now. Yeah. Oh I like that. I need to go, yeah, that was like that was like a lot harder. Um, no. Sure, yeah, yeah, usually back off earlier than that. Yeah, like, let's like, um, like I,
Speaker 1:
I just like needed a bunch like we like really get. Well, I feel like yeah, yeah, sure. What OK I have I also Let me check the one in here.
Speaker 2:
Logan and. I heard you weren't in our group message. Um, I was just asking to see if you wanted to go to a coffee shop for a second, but it sounds like you were trying to stay in this area. Um, I got like 30 minutes. Yeah, yeah, because I was planning on being there till 11, and then I was gonna try to before my 4. I was gonna try to go with, yeah, let's go to a coffee shop, um. Do you know any close to here? No, no. I'm about to look it up. You, you have to be somewhere around 30? No, I don't have anywhere to be. I was just gonna try to get uh some knocking in with. Uh, Logan and Rob for like an hour or so, but I have to do that. Well I can, I can join you for that at some point. Yeah, I just wanna make sure I do need to make sure that I protect my time allocation this weekend just because I need to finish the thing that I'm doing for you, and then I'm getting
Speaker 1:
the final evening of pickups
Speaker 2:
for my short movie on Wednesday, and I gotta make sure I'm prepped for that. Oh, I'm looking for coffee shops.
Speaker 1:
You're looking.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, there's like a, I think there's, there's a Starbucks around the corner at the Costco.
Speaker 1:
That's that's perfect. Let's meet there. Hm What's up? Uh, No, I, I wanna move my, I'll move my car
