Speaker 1:
Oh man, that, that's like the most common situation. I, I run into all these programs cause the free one it's only been around for like 2 years and You know, now that we're so close to the clean energy target, they're, it's like cheaper for them to pay for your system than to pay the fines that, uh, for PEPCO that they have to pay to produce dirty energy. So it's like a cool time to be going solar. Probably a good thing you didn't uh opt for it a couple years ago.
Speaker 2:
Cool
Speaker 1:
Do you know roughly what your highest electric bill is like in the summer?
Speaker 2:
I haven't handle a lot and I don't know. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
no worries.
Speaker 2:
3 to 400 or something. Yeah, it's a couple 100 at least. OK.
Speaker 1:
And uh if you actually have the um uh the bill pulled up, or if you're able to log into your PEPCO account, they list out all your usage, and that's really helpful. Do you know how old your current roof is on the home?
Speaker 2:
Uh, we had it put on, so. Uh, it's probably 20 years, yeah, 2025 years.
Speaker 1:
OK,
Speaker 2:
but it's
Speaker 1:
copper. Oh, nice. OK, cool, awesome. What kind of lifespan do you get on those,
Speaker 2:
uh, life, right? OK, yeah,
Speaker 1:
that's what I thought because I know like, I mean, I've done like metal route, like the like it's more common on I guess on like pitch res maybe or like the, uh, we'll we'll work with like slate brews and things like that and it's like, you know, hey, other like on those like hey, other than replacing a jingle or whatever, yeah, it's like it's kind of why you do it.
Speaker 2:
Yes, we, I guess the high $340 is at least September of last year.
Speaker 1:
We can definitely help with that. Um, on the 3rd, do you have the earliest, uh,
Speaker 2:
OK. I
Speaker 1:
know
Speaker 2:
if
Speaker 1:
you go
Speaker 2:
to the,
Speaker 1:
oh, you're on the actual
Speaker 2:
app. OK, great. That's easier.
Speaker 1:
And then there's this chart right here that has all your usage. It's actually pretty good for most of the year. It's really just in um. Like June to September, that's like getting up there, yeah, so we've got water heater. OK, yeah, we boiler that'll do it. OK. Let me enter in these numbers. Um, so I'm gonna enter in your usage, and then I'll just see how many panels fit on the roof. Uh, the way this works is like all the power you're instead of purchasing all your power from PEPCO, you'd be purchasing a portion or maybe all of your power from the panels and stuff and it's hooked up the same way as PEPCO is. It's all just like power purchase agreements, and this one, it's like you're just purchasing the power for a fixed 0 cent rate, and then that rate, it never changes, it never goes up. There's like no taxes, and then you just get free power for 30 years.
Speaker 2:
But is that like versus like if we buy the solar panels ourselves versus Yeah, you could, yeah, yeah, you could, yeah,
Speaker 1:
yeah, you could totally buy it if you want. Um, is it something you think you'd pay cash for or like finance? OK.
Speaker 2:
We also have to consider the We're approaching retirement age. Yeah. Oh, what? We're approaching retirement age and we are definitely not gonna be here in 30 years.
Speaker 1:
Oh yeah, gotcha. Well, it's not a, it's not a 30 year, uh, return investment, so. Let's see January 583. Uh, typically, like, depending on your project, it could be anywhere like uh 4 to 6 years of return on investment, and there's like a lot of different ways to set it up, but it's like, yeah, if it's a cash purchase, you know, you'll pay the 2030, 400 for it, and then, you know, all the incentives that you collect and the money you'll save on the bill, uh, about year 4 to 6, you make all your money back, and then anything you're getting at that point is, is pure profit,
Speaker 2:
yeah. And the DC website Today it was something about, yeah, or I don't know if you all are the DC website talking about if there's any tax incentives or anything left to help lower. I know some of those came and went.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, the one that, the main one, because there's really two incentives is the federal tax credit that the IRA uh set, and that is 30% of the system cost. As long as you have the tax liability, you'll get back in taxes. The other one is the local incentive where they're gonna be paying you for the power that you send to the grid cause it's clean energy, it's helping them get the target. The, the thing with the tax credit is you would not get it until 2026, um, because it's on the year that you're installed about 3 or 4 month insult timeline, so we'd be looking at like February, March for when the panels go up, and then when you do your taxes on the following year, you get it in 2026. Yeah. But yeah, if you're paying cash, then it's like, hey, that'll be a nice chunk of change that like, you know, you'll get at that point, so.
Speaker 2:
So still this next year. That is the one thing
Speaker 1:
with the, the purchase, um, you know, the purchase can be good, you know, the like 30% of, you know, a 2030 $40,000 cost, that's like pretty nice, but it even if you get installed like ASAP, if the tax credit goes away before you've applied for it in 2026, then you're out of luck. Yeah. So, the purchase can be cool, you do take a lot of risk, and then the free one, that's where it's like, hey, you'll have a lot more immediate benefit, but you won't be getting like the those payments or like you won't get like, you know, like a 50 check um when you do your taxes, um. You know, a year or two from now, um, but that one, as long as you have your application in for the free program, you're good. If they cut it all tomorrow, then you're good and they have to do it for you. So that's kind of like, you know, it's all your own timing and risk tolerance on it. Um, but about like 90 to 95% of my projects, uh, they do free ones, um, just cause it's way easier. Um, but if you wanna get involved with the purchase, that's like, that's awesome too.
Speaker 2:
I got
Speaker 1:
September.
Speaker 2:
Oh 3 September. Uh, cool.
Speaker 1:
Alright, I'm done with that now, thank you very much. And let's see what we're working with here. All right. The panels are the same, uh, no matter, like which way you do it, if you do the free one or if you decide to buy it. So the amount of power will be, you know, same. The savings on the bill will be the same. Only difference is like if you're paying nothing for it or if you're uh paying for it out of pocket or doing like financing thing. Um, so I'll start, I'll kind of start with that, and then I can kind of get into those how those work. We have it draw the roof.
Speaker 2:
For it. Right. We try pressing.
Speaker 1:
Do you have any friends or family or uh neighbors you talked to that have done one of
Speaker 2:
these
Speaker 1:
programs?
Speaker 2:
No, we haven't. OK.
Speaker 1:
Jumping right in man
Speaker 2:
awesome. Yeah Yeah, people gotten it, but we haven't talked to them about how they, what they used, how they did it. OK, no, he's got it. Across the street, those folks over there. Curious
Speaker 1:
if I have any over here. Let's
Speaker 2:
see And then the other question is also, yeah, the resale on the house if we do that, how does that?
Speaker 1:
Yeah, like when you go to sell your home, yeah, yeah, it hooks up because you're hooked up the same way you are to PEPCO, uh, you would just let, um, uh, you just give me a call or anyone at sustainable you and we'll get in touch with the new homeowner. They'll put their name on a half page form, and then they'll get all the same stuff that you did, OK, yeah. And if you're, it's pretty easy with like the cash cash purchase too, cause like, I mean, definitely don't sell your home before you mail all your money back, but uh uh that's the same thing that we just put it on there and really just be the warranties uh transferring over and like the power guarantees and everything uh cause they wouldn't have a payment on it.
Speaker 2:
All right. Right And let's see what panels can do. Yeah, that right there is just a little.
Speaker 1:
Do you know how tall it
Speaker 2:
is? Uh, not off the top of my head, but it's pretty short. It's actually like that, that white square is the patching, the white patching compounds.
Speaker 1:
00, gotcha.
Speaker 2:
You can go up there and you can look at it if you want.
Speaker 1:
Oh, check it on the. OK, I can probably do some more. Pan Have you ever heard of Solar Solution?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, that's the, the email or whatever the mail I got that I was just looking at. Oh
Speaker 1:
yeah, was that like the, um, hey,
Speaker 2:
there's like 50,000 dollars of funding for it was just really because it went to the DC website and then I went out and filled out the form and it was like a commercial form and I was a little unsure. Oh yeah on the DC website, right? So they just Yeah,
Speaker 1:
it's like kind of tricky because the um like the DOE has like they have like uh it's like they can't like recommend a certain company to do it. Like they would love to, you know, just put solar in everyone's house and might be like one solar company, but it's like that it's a monopoly and
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I work for the federal government. I know how that works.
Speaker 1:
OK, gotcha, gotcha.
Speaker 2:
So all that, yeah, yeah,
Speaker 1:
so they'll they'll at least pay for it. They at least like, you know, put up all the money,
Speaker 2:
so. OK. Looks good. Yeah. Yeah, depending on how high above the roof those are, you could possibly get over that. Yeah, if, if they're like. I pull this one out.
Speaker 1:
Cause sometimes, depending on the event too, like they'll like they'll cut event, you know, they'll just like trim it out down and like put panels over it. Like
Speaker 2:
for. Like for this one.
Speaker 1:
Oh yeah, like this one he just had this, uh, big bench sticking up in the middle and. Of course it doesn't come up.
Speaker 2:
I was like the angle that. Um
Speaker 1:
do this like that and it's like, like 3 ft tall for no reason. Is it something like that or is it more like like one of those?
Speaker 2:
The first one I pointed out is about as high as the dark part of and about as big a diameter. The other one, the other one is like a roof vent that's like about that big a diameter and I think. I think it's about that tall. It's got a fan in the top of it, but when they installed our HVAC, they stole the power from it. Oh, so, so the fan is pointless. So if honestly, if they want to chop it off and put. Something lower end or something that would be fine. Is that the one that one's just a little one like this, OK, and then that one's a fairly biggish one
Speaker 1:
like a
Speaker 2:
diameter
Speaker 1:
and that's what the one that like isn't in use.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, that's the one that has a fan in it that has no power.
Speaker 1:
OK, we can have that one's just
Speaker 2:
a tube with a bath on top of it, OK.
Speaker 1:
It does depend how uh high the parapet falls are, and that's that's different in every home,
Speaker 2:
but the north side is taller than the south side, and the north side is actually pretty tall. It's. It's probably not that tall.
Speaker 1:
OK, that'll give you a like a south facing tilt, which is really good to have on these.
Speaker 2:
No, it's going the other way. No. Because we want the toe going out. Yeah, oh no, this high side is that size, yeah, oh, OK, yeah, it's a lot shorter on, on their side it's only, it's only like 18 inches. And their side now has a, and I don't know, I doubt images as a deck roof deck, yeah, it's oh, OK, this side is our sister house, so we have a shared wall, OK. As far as it's what is happening. Yeah, so you don't need to knock on her door. Madhouse. Was built before our so ours literally leans against their
Speaker 1:
wall and just like crack and like creak sometimes.
Speaker 2:
No, no, it's, I mean, it's, it's a, it's a foot thick wall, but like on our side of the wall is only like a brick thick and a foot, as opposed to this one which is a foot thick and equally shared. Oh, OK. Yeah, I've seen a couple of houses like that or like they're both brick, but like there's like the tiniest gap between them and mortar between the two of them just like kind of connect it. It's kind of yeah and some of these are like cracks, but other points are touching and like they spread out again. It's like a little crack all that it's more visible on that side than on the front. Um, have you guys done any additions to the house? Um, we haven't added any. We are, we have a shed off the back that used to be apparently a full bathroom. No, they're making it into one we gave up. Oh yeah, no, no, it was a full bathroom. They were gonna turn it into a half bath, and then they give it the people before us, and then they gave up on that, and now it's just a shed, and we're and we would have torn it off, but we're gonna, we were hoping to grandfather OK. Yeah, so, so. This house was broken into apartments of World War 2, broken up, and then I was a ton of these houses were when they weren't owned, and then after World War II. Um, a large family lived here, I keep running into we run into people, they're like, like a doctor's appointments and they're the receptionist and they're like. I used to live across the street from there and so, um, so there were family, you know, large families living here and then um. And then it became a rental property, so it had really shitty repairs all the way through. We found one where newspaper from 1972 was used to actually insulate the outlets, yeah, insulate the outlet like no kidding. Oh boy. And then, um, the guys before us bought it were one was grad school, I guess he was in law school and his mom bought it for him back when they were really dirt cheap. And he was they were gonna renovate it, never did. I just rented it out to the apartments, other students and then then we bought it, yeah, so and 12 years into our 10 year plan to do it ourselves, we hired. We decided our relationship was more important than the house. Oh, yeah, apparently in World War 1, 8th Street was a um was a recovery place for soldiers coming back from the war, uh, for recuperation, and supposedly this was a like a hospice kind of a yeah there's a bricked up doorway that connects with them they're not yeah, it's right there. Oh, you're right, you're right, actually it's over there, but yeah, but yeah, it connects us. Went through their basement. Oh wow. So you guys have a basement? OK. Is it big or is it small? It's the same footprint as this, but it's a workshop. It's not like full finished basement. How tall are the ceilings not legal. OK I think they might be barely 7 ft, but if you actually put like a ceiling on the underside of the joist, they would not be. Gotcha. Do you guys have a sump down there? Oh, we do in the front. We should have put one on that wall, but we didn't. Got you, very cool. Also A was a red light district for the recovering from World War One. Oh man, we're told and we haven't seen any, um, with that door between the two that they had, um. Uh, during prohibition that people could like one of these was a speakeasy kind of thing and then one of these, but not yours, it's the neighbors, you know, don't worry about it to the other one and that way the place when the was the stories we've heard. We haven't the previous guys did put in a guard in the back when they were digging up all the crappy dirt to put in real dirt tons of bottles. Oh man. Alright,
Speaker 1:
cool. This is about, you see it a little bit too Martin. Uh, this is about what we can fit on your roof space. Obviously, we can't put anything where you have your HVAC and all those sort of things, but Uh, these go on, uh, what most often happens is we just put it on rails that go across the parapet walls, so we won't have to touch any of the copper part of it, and what that looks like is like
Speaker 2:
this. Yeah, we see one of the houses like that. Yeah, yeah, on the block, yeah,
Speaker 1:
yeah, it's all around, so we won't have to touch the copper and then we'll just put it on the rails, lay it across, and that's how we get over some of those obstructions so we can get, get more panels up there. Cool. And what this would do with your electric bill. It is cool. You're using about 10,000 kilowatt hours for the year, and that's from all those numbers I added up for each month on the bill. So, your yearly spend on the power is currently at 16 cents kilowatt, so you're spending like $1600 a year for your power. So, not bad. That's like, yeah, it's about, it's about average, so. The system would produce like maybe 60 kilowatts less than that. So you'll get 99% of your power covered, and these are, these are pretty conservative too, so I'd say like, hey, maybe 100%.
Speaker 2:
No, with the, yeah, with the hot summers coming in, maybe. Oh yeah, well, well,
Speaker 1:
this is off the last year's too, so which was like way hotter. Like I can say I had probably had like 10 clients like they just replaced their HC H back or like get a um a uh replace it with a heat pump or something it just busted. It was working too hard.
Speaker 2:
So I'm actually we'd be kind of happy about having our roof sheeted.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I don't know what the science is on that, but it's like, yeah, there's less heat on the roof, so like it it can it can keep the house cooler. I don't know like what the exactly, but it will be cooler to some degree. I don't know if it's, but. Um, yeah, that's like pretty much how it works, and then, yeah, like I usually come up with a different number if it's a different offset, but it's like with the free program with the purchase program, you're gonna get $1600 power for free, and that's, that's pretty much it. The only difference is with the free program, then You pay nothing, they'll come out here, they'll look it up, and then you just start saving money as soon as it starts producing power. If you want to buy it, like, cool, we uh send you an invoice for the purchase price, uh, once we put it up on the roof and finish the construction, and then you'd start getting paid for all the power you're making, uh, I think it starts like 2 months after that, after they start, you know, getting all those credits from your system, and then That's uh that's pretty much it, and then 2026, uh, if you have a tax liability, you'll get the tax credit if it's still there and uh. Yeah.
Speaker 2:
So I always wonder like what's the catch? It's just hard to believe there's a free program that you can't, you know, I've heard some of the, the nightmare stories at least like out in the Southwest and Southeast or southwest wherever in the Midwest somewhere.
Speaker 1:
The, the catch is. Is the free program, you don't get the incentives. They're gonna keep the incentives to pay for it, and they can like they can be pretty lucrative, like there's a reason why they're paying millions and millions of dollars to do the free one for people so that, you know, they can use those to pay for it and then, you know, keep profiting after that. And that's where it's like, hey, you can totally buy it too, but I mean, almost no one I work with does because the catch with the purchase is, like, it can be lucrative, but you're also taking all the risk, because the payments you're getting paid for the power is all at like a market rate, like, it goes up and down, and it's like, also not like a like a sock or something that goes up. It is like scheduled to go down. And it makes sense too, right, because like supply and demand, the more clean power there is on the grid, there's less they're gonna be uh willing to pay for it. It's coupled to the opposite fine that uh PECO has to pay. So as we, this is a great time to do it, but like it's like, you know, if you want to buy it like 5 years from now, it's gonna be like a much worse deal because the incentive have gone down. So, yeah, if you do the free one, you miss out on the incentives, but you also take zero risk on the free one. And that's why that's the one that pretty much everyone does. Um, the purchase one can be really cool, um, and again, all about your uniming risk tolerance, but, you know, if you wanna invest in the project, like, great, we can totally set that up, you know, you'll start getting paid for the power, uh, after it's installed and producing, and then Uh, you know, kind of cross our fingers of the tax credits still there in 2026,
Speaker 2:
yeah. So we're definitely interested in doing it, um, yeah, just which option to go for, yeah, I'm inclined toward the free one.
Speaker 1:
And we have a lot of people that, you know, find themselves in that situation. Like I definitely think the purchase option like is worth entertaining like, you know, if uh you know, like Cors like, hey, it's, it's, it can be great but um what we do, we're pretty flexible with it too because a lot of people find themselves in that situation. A lot of people that end up doing the purchase for me, they'll, you can submit it as a free project and then anytime before installation, you can just switch it over to purchase. So like we just went with Aula the other night and like they're going on their honeymoon like for like next week and I'm like, hey, I do not want you thinking about like home projects like like this or anything else while you're like in Africa joined your safari honeymoon thing, um, you know. You'll have all the holidays to think about, you know, purchase options, we can uh come back and go through all those, and you'll have like till like February or March to, you know, say, hey, you know, what, let's like, do the purchase. And some people hit me up the day before I install, and they'll switch it over, and that's totally fine. But if it's um if you're sure it's something you wanna do, then it's like you can definitely get the ball rolling with the free one and then uh switch it over later or just keep it as free, but that at least locks you in for the uh to so that you're guaranteed that you'll at least get the free one. There's also options to after if you have the free project installed, there are certain points where you can purchase it yourself like year 6 is like a really it's the best deal you can get if you purchase it after a free install because they've like made all their money back, but it's like if you, if you install a free project and then like 6 months later you're like, hey, can I buy it? Like they'll let you do it. But like they're gonna want to recoup, you know, they were gonna they're expecting to make all their, they haven't made all their money back yet, so not might not be a good deal, um, but that's like kind of your options with doing that, um, but yeah, with the free project you just submit an application and then they'll set up a site survey with you, they'll hop up on the roof, they'll take all the measurements and make sure it's good to go. And then we'll send all that into PEPCO, and uh they'll uh like for approval, and then after that, we'll submit it to the Department of Buildings, and we'll get building permits, and then after all those come back, you'll be ready for install, and we'll be reaching out, um, probably February, March to um schedule a day for you, and it all goes up in a day. Um, sometimes they just knock it out in the afternoon or morning.
Speaker 2:
So because it's sitting on top like that, they go through the roof and everything.
Speaker 1:
Correct, yeah, it's like, um, they do, it's like every roof is different, but it's like we'll have like the engineering drawing like, you know, right after the survey. So like they are very like, you know, we're working with the like electric company and apartment buildings. It has to be perfect. And like if we like literally if we don't have like the right color zip ties or if like a sticker is like 2 inches from where they they like it to be, then it's like they can cause a fuss so like they're uh very prepared I'll say.
Speaker 2:
Um, what are the requirements for the actual electrical tie in? Yeah, cause it is, it is actually literally right below that point.
Speaker 1:
Like that's where your meter is? Yeah, OK,
Speaker 2:
yeah. And where's the back door? Yeah, it's right there in the face as far as oh, not the meter, well, not the meter, but yeah, no, meters well, the box, the box is. Oh, OK, let me see power comes in from the back. OK.
Speaker 1:
So great they'd actually put the um
Speaker 2:
the original house yeah it's an underground from that side.
Speaker 1:
Uh, so they would put the inverter box. Uh, right, they put it right next to the meter, so, uh, there wouldn't be anything on the front of the home, which is great, and I'm pulling out, where's the
Speaker 2:
meters outside the back door. Or the basement down there. But The gas meters up. Oh, OK, that's what I'm getting confused on the gas meter. All right,
Speaker 1:
and
Speaker 2:
this is,
Speaker 1:
did you want like the like electrical schematics? Like the,
Speaker 2:
oh,
Speaker 1:
OK,
Speaker 2:
OK, I didn't just curious. I like it I just recall something I was looking at when we when we were last time. OK, great. I'm an electronic technician, OK. OK.
Speaker 1:
You, you're definitely more qualified than I am. Um, I can at least show you like, I mean I could, I could, I could like pull up stuff and like maybe you can make sense, you could probably make sense of it, but the Uh, we'll just tie in, we tie into your main panel, um, so they'll pop inside to check that out on the survey, and they'll need access to it on inside install day as well. Otherwise everything is on the outside and trying to find a picture of the inverter so I can kind of show you what that. What's that?
Speaker 2:
Go up. I mean, isn't that,
Speaker 1:
um, that's just with the main panel that's
Speaker 2:
just the. Yeah, breaker function. There's like maybe they didn't take a picture. Um
Speaker 1:
Or they must be.
Speaker 2:
What was the red and black box and some of the pictures,
Speaker 1:
uh, no, it's a, it's like a white box they. Maybe they just didn't upload it, yeah. Oh, he's not installed, that's why, OK. Those are all from the survey. This is from like uh install. We take a lot of pictures if you. I want pictures after as well.
Speaker 2:
Um, so they were cementing the footings to the roof.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, this one is, this one is a solar stack one. So for these systems, They do or here's a better picture. It's uh an adhesive mount. It's like um like cement super glue if you wanna think about it like that, and they just pop it down and then attach the panels to that, and then there's like no roof penetrations, and it's a little bit low profile and it's like a little bit cheaper for them to do. Um,
Speaker 2:
yeah, OK, yeah, I just don't want holes in the roof. Yeah, they can glue to it all they want. Oh yeah.
Speaker 1:
Oh, here we go.
Speaker 2:
This is a good picture. What about damage and stuff, I mean, we don't have trees, so.
Speaker 1:
Great question, but there are two like things that can go wrong with these projects in terms of like damages and maintenance. Number one is like an act of God, which is like tree falling on it or like a hurricane or something like that. And that's all covered by, if you buy it, if you do the purchase, it would be first by your homeowners insurance and then we're a backup if for For some reason they don't want to cover it and then for the free one doesn't matter whatever happens, whether it's a tree fallen or an act of God or just regular, uh, you know, defect defective panel or something, they're gonna cover all of it and then your homeowners insurance will be back up. That's the only like football.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, no trees on that. OK, yeah, and then you never know what's gonna happen around here I suppose a hurricane or something, yeah,
Speaker 1:
and I don't, I don't tell anyone like, hey, it's like 30 years. Like I, I don't think I should tell anyone like, hey, nothing's gonna go wrong in in 30 years. I mean, there's no, there's no regular maintenance. It's not like there's no moving parts. You don't need like an oil change on. Or something, um, but like let's say your inverter just goes out at like year 6. It's all monitored so you can, you can get in and out on your phone and see what it's doing. So like you'll get a notification and we have the same access to the same stuff. We'll get a notification and we'll probably be calling you up and saying like, hey, we noticed your inverters out, um, you know, can we come out on Friday to replace it for you? And then, you know, that's all coverage just don't, uh. Get up on your roof and start smashing it with a hammer, and you, you won't be on the hook for uh any potential uh maintenance or damage that would need to be fixed on the system. OK, cool. And the free one too, they, I mean, it's not like written anywhere but like they, they have a little bit more incentive to come out here too because like if your system is not making power they're not making their money so they come out here pretty quick um but uh this is the uh the setup so the inverter converts the I, I, I know this, I know this, the system uh produces DC power and converts it to AC power that home can use. That's the point of that. Uh, and that's an emergency shut off, and then go straight into your meter, and then any excess that you don't use will go out to the grid.
Speaker 2:
OK. Cool, so yeah. Mhm. Let's go ahead and go for it. Go for it in the free version and then figure out what we're doing, yeah, OK,
Speaker 1:
yeah, and I'm more than happy to keep in touch with you on the, on the purchase option and kind of just bounce it around and hey, if you guys wake up one day and you're like, hey, we really want to buy it or Uh yeah we can go in. Oh yeah, if you, hey, if you win a lottery like yeah.
Speaker 2:
And and. Get a roofer up there to preemptively uh maintain everything while there's still access to it.
Speaker 1:
So yeah,
Speaker 2:
you have plenty of time. Can you get it done?
Speaker 1:
And they do a pretty good job checking out um to on the survey. Like if it does need any like even like, like really small repairs like the flashing on this thing isn't like, you know, like, you know, up the code or, or whatever, like how, how it should be, like they'll let you, they'll let you know and um you know, you can address any problems um after that. Usually I would say like if they find out you need a new roof, but I mean if it's copper, then like, OK, you're good.
Speaker 2:
No, the only concern I really have is they just redid their roof and I don't know what they did to Where where the overlap the firewalls.
Speaker 1:
Oh yeah,
Speaker 2:
because they, they put something, they put their roof over that overlaps now on our side, then I don't know if they cut away ours or or uh overlap contract or a flipper yeah it wasn't though, not the owner, so yeah.
Speaker 1:
I would say worst case scenario cause like sometimes we run into that where like, you know, someone uh like did something like that and they like It's like when the most commonly I run into it when the neighboring home has a system on it and they use a little bit more of the parapet wall than they should have. If they use too much of like, like your side of the parapet wall, we probably just do like the solar stack one instead if there isn't enough room for a beam, but like since it's usually only with the I wouldn't see any reason they wouldn't be able to do it. Yeah. But yeah, that's like why we do the site survey too. I can only, you know, see so much from the um from the satellite and the blurry satellite
Speaker 2:
picture. Yeah.
Speaker 1:
And if there's any, uh, it is a recent picture though, like this
Speaker 2:
was yeah yeah yeah I was gonna say with her and they had that there's that tub that I bought for plants that's. So I've only been there a couple of months, but yeah, like the, the chimney doesn't do anything anymore. It's really, it's really only the left half of that, yeah, but there's nothing attached to the chimney anymore, so we could actually literally have that removed.
Speaker 1:
Oh, interesting. Yeah, if there's like low cost stuff, I'll, I'll take a look at the pictures too. If there's like low cost stuff that like, um, most common thing I could think of is like when we, if you have like a a satellite dish that you're not using anymore, a bunch of people have those and we can add another panel if we take it off. We'll just take it off for you,
Speaker 2:
so that we don't have, but uh. Yeah, I know, I like don't know chimney isn't a flu or something doesn't do anything. So they didn't go through it? Not since we got the new water here which bends out underneath that window. And then,
Speaker 1:
could you please text or email me the, a copy of the electric bill? My number and email are right on there. And then I just have to make sure the application. Just City records.
Speaker 2:
OK
Speaker 1:
And uh whose uh name did you wanna put it in?
Speaker 2:
Uh, You might as well come in mind. OK, it really doesn't matter since you're both on it. Yeah, I was, I was making note that it didn't say. It does yes. By the way, I really like to paint in here. I was thinking about painting like my kitchen like a similar color just like the, it's a smaller kitchen, um, but like just like liven it up and make it feel like, you know, bigger and kind of like more like alive, you know, so I wanna keep like white ceilings like you guys did, um, but yeah, I, I really like it. This is like yellow slightly. Well yeah, I can't remember what color this is. That one Chicago Blood of this one's Chicago Blue. This one's like money red or something. I never understood that red, yeah, something good, something to do with money. Oh no,
Speaker 1:
I can't remember what this one is. What's the best email for you Eric?
Speaker 2:
Uh, clever, so my
Speaker 1:
last name and first initial.
Speaker 2:
OK, at yahoo.com. Awesome.
Speaker 1:
Cool. And then this is gonna send a DocuSign invite to your uh phone and that email, and you could fill it on on either one. And I'm gonna make sure the address is matching
Speaker 2:
as well. Yeah we don't care about cleaning the house. We just care about art. Yeah, I was looking around. So who's a collector or one of you guys an artist? We're both, we just like art. I painted that right there, yeah, that's about it so far. And well, the one, yeah, I did that ostrich, the ostrich and the lady there, yeah, and that lady and stuff, but yeah and one in the room. There was like a ton of paintings there yeah like uh yeah, we, we need to start just putting them all over the. Because you see, we don't have been there for years. All the more reason, I guess not sell the house so we can put those stupid paintings up by them. You guys like to do a lot of traveling? We haven't we like to, yeah, when our parents were younger they used to drag us along on all sorts of great stuff which they paid for. Isn't that awesome we were just the driver and the navigator. Now we're just they're all old. And we're lazy homebodies. Call us those vacation leeches. You make the plans, yeah, I just send a check and we're just willing to show up and we'll be happy to go as long as you don't plan it, we're good. Can you check if
Speaker 1:
you got um the doctor sign
Speaker 2:
invite?
Speaker 1:
And if anything's too small on and thanks for emailing the bill, if anything's too small on there, I have it pulled up on, yeah. And then there's 2 things I'll show you on it.
Speaker 2:
I OK Agreeing to things.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, it'll have you do it, have you a natural like literally every part of it,
Speaker 2:
um, so that one.
Speaker 1:
Yes, oh yeah,
Speaker 2:
residential solar system lease agreement, yes.
Speaker 1:
And each section that it has you initial, there's a uh like a, it'll have like a brief explanation on it. Um, so we don't have to sit here to like. Free,
Speaker 2:
but if you want
Speaker 1:
to, we can.
Speaker 2:
I can I can you need to do it now or
Speaker 1:
um I can't do or we can't do anything until it's like submitted, um. But
Speaker 2:
uh,
Speaker 1:
Like if you had any questions on it, I'd wanna make sure I answer those um before I go. Um, so you feel, we just want you to feel good about it,
Speaker 2:
so. I mean, yeah, I, I'll have to look at it bigger to actually be able to get have questions. Oh yeah, am I supposed to fill in all the red boxes?
Speaker 1:
Nope, those you just skip right over. That's like pretty, uh, fill it out.
Speaker 2:
Hm, just like. Is initially for both of us. He's got it there you go.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, if you want to read the, um, I'll show you the two, important ones I show people, and then you feel free to go through it. This is just a blank one. Um, OK. This is what you are agreeing to pay for your power for the next 20 years, and it's fixed at $0.00 per kilowatt hour for all the years that you're gonna have the system on your house. Additionally, on the last page of this part, It lists this out as
Speaker 2:
well.
Speaker 1:
My
Speaker 2:
internet
Speaker 1:
That's about
Speaker 2:
here. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
page 1 it was working. Yeah, try like, uh, I'm on like page maybe on page 18. Maybe it's with the zoo.
Speaker 2:
OK,
Speaker 1:
now it's coming up.
Speaker 2:
So install solar panels. Get whatever benefit comes from obviously the city and whatever. Um, we don't pay electric bill at all.
Speaker 1:
So you're, you're paying an electric bill. The rate that you're paying, and that's why, uh, that's why I always show these two things, uh, to people is because it's like, hey, you're gonna pay us the monthly payment, and like if you miss your monthly payment, there's a late fee. The monthly payment is $0. So it's like if you find a way to uh not be able to pay, like even on here, like if you find it, there's like one that's like, uh, if there's, if there's something that's gonna affect your ability to pay the monthly payment, you should let us know. So if there's like gonna be something that's gonna affect your ability to pay $0 for something, then you should let me know, and it's like sounds kind of dumb. But um these are set up like uh sometimes we'll do like a monetized version like is
Speaker 2:
it, is it Pepco or WasA that keeps screwing up our billing.
Speaker 1:
Oh, how are they? How have they screwed up your bill?
Speaker 2:
The one that you keep sending for auto pay and then they keep sending us. No, no, no, they only send the paper bill, but it's still paid. Yeah, the payment side. They just keep sending me a paper bill in spite of me going, I don't paperless is fine, and they keep sending it.
Speaker 1:
Geico does that to me.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I've canceled it and canceled paper billing and or paperless and put paperless back on, it doesn't matter. I'll still send it. Alright, well, I'll do you
Speaker 1:
buttering. OK, this was the one I wanted to show you. OK,
Speaker 2:
you're both,
Speaker 1:
yeah, uh, so it's again, it's uh 240 months for 20 years, and it, the total cost of this lease is $0. The total cost of all the payments are $0. Your monthly payments each month throughout the initial term is $0. If it's a $5 fee, if you fail to pay the $0 auto payment and then the total of all your monthly payments is $0 and we'll never collect any payment information for you. Um, it does have you click a thing that's like, uh, oh yeah, like we can like check your credit or whatever we're not gonna collect any information from you. We can check your credit whether it's just your, um, your name and uh address.
Speaker 2:
So what happens at the end of 20 years? Yeah,
Speaker 1:
great question. At the end of 20 years, you got a couple options. You can have us take it off the home for No cost. Uh, you could buy the system if you wanted to at that point. Uh, what most people do is you can renew this for up to 2010 years after. So after the 20, there's 10, so you get 30 years, and they kind of assume you're gonna do that, um, cause I don't know who, you know, would want to take you like go back to paying PEPCO, but yep, it's uh it would get extended to 30 years and then uh what happens at 30 years? Uh, you'll probably just own it at your 30, cause
Speaker 2:
like we. Is the cost depreciating that whole time, or oh yeah, yeah, right, because there's gotta be because that's the other thing, the hesitation is there was always new technology like, you know, Stanford just came out with something that's flexible and not gonna break and it's like, yeah, when's that gonna be commercially available like.
Speaker 1:
Oh yeah, yeah, like
Speaker 2:
I'm sure in 20-30 years. Oh
Speaker 1:
yeah, I, I think at that point, like 20-30 years from now, they're gonna have like, like utility scale solar, and then it's like residential is not gonna make as much sense. They'll figure out the battery tech, um, yeah, better, you know, better techology is always gonna come out, but the free program isn't always gonna be around. So it's like, hey, something 5% better might come out next year, but might not be able to get it for free.
Speaker 2:
Well I figured in 30 years is not gonna be my problem anyway, but if we sell the house, what do I tell them? Oh yeah,
Speaker 1:
the um the output at like year 30, it's gonna be like 90% output as year one. So it's like they might be up there longer than I'm around so. Yeah
Speaker 2:
Yeah So should I do all these initials now? Go for it, don't. That's back to the beginning of the document. There's a lot of pages. How many pages is this? It's
Speaker 1:
uh it's 18. It also has the, it has you put your name on the um the DOB form, all the forms we send to PEPCO for the interconnecting to the grid and the PJM form. It just has you put your name on it. If you see a bunch of like, Like lines for like name and address and stuff. You don't have to fill any of that out. It's like on this one. Like you don't have to fill any of that out. It'll just like have you put your name on it and then when we go to submit with the DOB we'll figure out all that stuff and put it up below the rest of
Speaker 2:
it
Speaker 1:
until
Speaker 2:
we hit this. Yeah, if you hit the start,
Speaker 1:
it'll, yeah, it'll like jump to each one. And if it's like a, like a red one, it'll just skip through and then the just hit next we'll just zip you to the end and if you miss one, it'll, uh, it'll catch you at the end.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, just like when you're trying to pay for something and it's like, oh, you missed line number 32 up here.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They always make it um. Uh, like I think it could, it could be more difficult. We could make it more difficult.
Speaker 2:
The government pharmacy, you missed a line. It's like, well, which one? I don't see it right around the box. I don't see anything. What am I supposed to redo. OK, so I initially once and then I just tap everything, yeah.
Speaker 1:
And uh so you, uh, Yin from Solar Solution or um I don't know, maybe if he, if he's sick that day, maybe someone else, um, but Yesen usually will be the one reaching out uh to schedule the inspection with you. Uh, I don't know if they, I think they have availability on like Friday, but they'll, they'll find out a day for you that works and. Hop over. Uh, it's about like 30, 40 minutes maybe. They'll get up there, they'll take all the pictures and check your breaker box. That's the only thing that they'll have to do on the inside. And then that'll be it. Um, it's really just 3 days. You, you have to be here, uh, site survey, install, and today. So thanks for being here. And yeah, that's uh that's pretty much it. And then uh once uh we have the application, I'll send all this in tonight, and then uh they should be giving you a call tomorrow. And uh I'm always the best person to contact you. Uh, I get like weekly like summarized updates on all these projects. There are like there's like 100 clients I'm like working with right now, so it's, it's a lot, but like I, I very, I try to keep very organized and I have like, you know, they summarize everything for me every week and I'll send you important updates like we'll reach out to you or your source. we'll reach out to you on PEPCO approval and on DOB approval and when you're ready to install. But sometimes there's like, you know, 6 weeks between those approvals come. If you need anything or wanna see like where your project's at, then just hit me up and let me know. I'll check on it. And if anything important happens in, in between those two, I'll be the first to let you know.
Speaker 2:
I was Pepco account holder typing a name in there.
Speaker 1:
That one's fine. You can skip the, uh, if you hit next, yeah,
Speaker 2:
it is really helpful. I don't know. OK, that's Yeah, currently I work from home part time, so and then go to work, you know. I don't know what's gonna happen with the new administration. She'll have to go to work full time, so I'm sure they'll change that.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, is yours one of the jobs that like my like.
Speaker 2:
I work for Customs and Border Protection, but I'm a civilian, so I have no clue. Oh
Speaker 1:
they might give me more hours,
Speaker 2:
yeah, and I work in the AI, so, um, oh, I don't know, might be working for Elon Musk who knows. Oh dang, so we'll see. I have no idea what's gonna, what's gonna happen because I heard they're getting rid of one of our AI shops because, uh, so I have, yeah, there's rivers flying left, right, and sideways, so who knows what's gonna happen. Oh yeah. So yeah, so I'm working for someone that they definitely want, but I don't know if they'll. Um,
Speaker 1:
is it, it's not in there. Uh, I would
Speaker 2:
put it
Speaker 1:
in there, yeah, that's,
Speaker 2:
yeah, but I don't know what's gonna happen. No one knows. I curious, very curious. I'm sure they're gonna like, I can't see why they would want to move Customs and Border Protection, you know, when they talk about moving the headquarters. Why wouldn't you move the headquarters closer to a border, especially, you know, so I can see them saying, oh, we're going to move, blah blah blah, 8.0. I can, I can leave the government at least keep my benefits and next year, mid next year, so I'm like, OK. I have
Speaker 1:
so you you're like a year from retirement, not
Speaker 2:
retirement, just leaving and then when I actually retire I can still retain my benefits because I'm over 20 years in the government. So, so I can go, yeah, work somewhere else hopefully for like I think it's just trying to get me. I think you get a lot of money. You don't have to make like a work for nonprofit install the app. Get paid in money or get paid in feel goods. Make up for the karma for working for the CDP for so long.
Speaker 1:
What's like the coolest thing with AI that uh um like you've seen in in or we would like get that. I, I, I think it's so cool.
Speaker 2:
Well, actually what we're doing though is trying to be able to look at the X-rays from, you know, vehicles crossing the border, so we're looking for the drugs and the fentanyl and stuff to look less and it's just not there yet. It's not. You can't find, you know, you can have fentanyl comes in liquid, you know, powder, pill shape, and all this other stuff. And so when you've got a Basically the equivalent of a of a Amazon truck with everyone's packages in there. Yeah, it's nowhere near ready,
Speaker 1:
so they'll they'll stuff it in a watermelon or something. Yeah, yeah,
Speaker 2:
we've got plenty of its machine learning, so. You have to teach it what this stuff looks like in an X-ray. Yeah, unfortunately this stuff looks like it wants to look like at this point. It could be anything, so it's just not ready, but leadership doesn't know that and so we've got. Put it in the field they're like, OK, yeah, yeah, unfortunately AI has been oversold publicly and so Congress and everyone else thinks, well, why can't you just hire someone to do it for you, which is probably what's gonna happen. So Musk will come in and solve all our problems, I'm sure. So yeah, AI is one of my. Supervisors trigger words. That's mine now thanks to the leadership. Such a good way. But the other stuff with like I'm looking at like histories of companies across and and patterns and all that stuff is fascinating that data, all that data, yeah, I just work in computer vision, so it's not quite, quite there, but that stuff is great.s a lot. Pretty cool, yeah, it's pretty cool.
Speaker 1:
I think this is good. I'm just waiting for it to load. Um, I do have a, a Zoom in a couple of minutes here. I'm gonna have to hop on and, OK, perfect. OK. It is all good. And then, uh, once they get all the measurements and stuff and confirm the panel system, then they'll put the, they'll like uh countersign it and put all the uh specifics info info on there and then you can get like a uh updated one after. That that has like, you know, your exact system size. There's typically not too many changes, but if there's anything we find out on the survey like, oh we definitely can't put a panel there like, oh hey, maybe we can add another panel or two. I'll let you know as well um if there's any significant changes.
Speaker 2:
OK, when, when are they gonna, what's the likely schedule as far as when the, when the survey comes and when the work might start.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, the, I just asked about their availability earlier uh this week. I know, I know their Friday is open right now, um, so they might be able to come out this week for you. Um, they're usually pretty quick. Sometimes it's like, you know, next day, or, well, it's like too late today to do next day, but um,
Speaker 2:
that's fine, yeah,
Speaker 1:
it's
Speaker 2:
pretty quick.
Speaker 1:
Overall timeline is like 3 or 4 months, so it's like mid November now, so I'd probably say. Like mid February, mid March is when I would expect it. Um, It's for uh uh for the insult, yeah, OK, and then they just put it up in a day, and that's about it. Sometimes, um, you know, sometimes things get helped up like the DOB, like, had like a massive like computer crash or some weird thing this summer and it like extended every installer's projects like by like 4 weeks and it was like, oh man. And every once in a while, like maybe 1 out of 100 projects like PEPCO will just deny it and they'll like. Um, cause they're sending power back to the grid and it's like, oh hey, you gotta upgrade the uh transformer for your neighborhood. You want to pay like 500, you know, um, to upgrade the, be super nice and upgrade the grid for the neighborhood. Like, no. And like if things like that happen, then it's like, well, hey, at least we tried. Uh, you wouldn't be forced to, to do that. But I do also let people know just in case, but um yeah, it should be good. I've had a couple other projects over here like I was just talking to Justin Laus girl, man, I gotta run. Yeah, if you ever need anything, uh, we're around here a bunch. Our office is just up in like northern or uh union
Speaker 2:
market
