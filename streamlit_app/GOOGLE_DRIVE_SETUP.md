# Google Drive Setup for Sales Call Simulator

This guide explains how to organize your Google Drive folders for optimal use with the Sales Call Simulator.

## Folder Structure

Create three main folders in your Google Drive:

1. **Simulation Calls** - Contains high-quality, complete call transcripts
2. **Technical Documents** - Contains product specs, contracts, policy documents
3. **General Calls** - Contains additional call transcripts

## Obtaining Folder IDs

To get the ID of a Google Drive folder:

1. Open the folder in your web browser
2. The URL will look like: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j`
3. The folder ID is the part after `/folders/`: `1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j`

## Document Guidelines

### Simulation Calls Folder

- Include your best, most representative call transcripts
- Keep them unedited and complete
- Aim for 5-10 high-quality calls that demonstrate ideal sales techniques
- Google Docs format is recommended
- Naming convention: `Call_Transcript_[Topic]_[Date].doc`

### Technical Documents Folder

- Product specifications
- Pricing documents
- Contract templates
- Policy documentation
- FAQ documents
- Technical specifications for solar panels
- Installation guidelines
- Naming convention: `Technical_[Category]_[Name].doc`

### General Calls Folder

- Additional call transcripts
- Training materials
- Call scripts
- Objection handling guides
- Naming convention: `General_[Category]_[Name].doc`

## Service Account Access

1. Ensure your Google service account has access to all three folders:
   - Right-click each folder in Google Drive
   - Click "Share"
   - Add the service account email (ends with `.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
   - Give "Viewer" access

2. Wait a few minutes for permissions to propagate

## Best Practices

1. **Document Format**: Google Docs format works best for consistent extraction

2. **File Size**: Keep individual files under 1MB when possible

3. **Document Structure**:
   - Use clear headings
   - Include speaker labels in transcripts (e.g., "Sales Rep:" and "Customer:")
   - Structure technical documents with clear sections

4. **Updates**: If you update documents, reload them in the app using the "Reset and Load New Documents" button

5. **Metadata Consistency**: Use consistent naming patterns to help with organization

## Troubleshooting

- If documents aren't appearing, check sharing permissions
- If loading is slow, consider reducing the number of documents
- If document content seems incorrect, check if you need to re-export Google Docs to refresh the content
