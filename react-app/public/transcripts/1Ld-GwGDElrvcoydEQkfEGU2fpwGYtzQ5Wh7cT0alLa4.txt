Speaker 1:
Hey there, G. This is Martin over at Sustainable You. Good afternoon. Hey, how you doing? Doing amazing. Uh, we're the ones doing the free solar program. Uh, I was just curious, have you guys been able to take advantage of that yet?
Speaker 2:
Uh, no, I actually spoke to somebody and that's just not something we're interested in at the moment.
Speaker 1:
OK, gotcha. I would have been Paul.
Speaker 2:
Maybe.
Speaker 1:
OK, real good. I'm sure you've probably seen what happened in the news with Trump pausing all the funding for the solar stuff. So yeah, if you were to purchase the solar system right now, you wouldn't get that 30% tax credits, um, but that has not affected the free side of solar, so free solar still exists right now. So we're just looking to help out the people who know about it, do the free solar program before anything might change on that side of it. Does that make sense?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, understood. I, I appreciate it. I just don't think that's something we're gonna be getting involved in at the moment. OK,
Speaker 1:
got you. No worries. Is it just like a timing thing or just at all? I, I just, I just want to know for my sake.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I, I think it's just an add all thing. I think if we were to get solar it'd probably be something we purchased, but I'm not sure we're gonna be here that long. Um, and so if we're to move, we'll probably revisit this at that point.
Speaker 1:
OK, right on. Yeah, and I would not recommend purchasing it right now just with all the uncertainty stuff in the air with the pausing of the funding for that. So yeah, I wouldn't recommend that. Well, thanks. I appreciate you. Have a good one. Bye. You too
