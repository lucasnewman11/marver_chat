Speaker 1:
Right I was see, how's it going?
Speaker 2:
Hey Paul, how are you doing?
Speaker 1:
Doing good, doing good. How's the new year for you so far?
Speaker 2:
New Year's, uh, not too bad, actually. I mean, uh, barring the, the weather, everything, but, uh, but yeah, it's fine, you know, just getting back into work and everything. I've been traveling, uh, the past one month. Yeah. How have you been?
Speaker 1:
I've been doing good. Our business has been crazy like with the new administration and everything like we've like tripled, I think the past couple months, so it's like hard to stay on top of it all, but Um.
Speaker 2:
Nice, yeah,
Speaker 1:
we're
Speaker 2:
so,
Speaker 1:
so going strong, so.
Speaker 2:
Hi, how's it going? All good. All right, so, yeah,
Speaker 1:
back to Pakistan, or where were you traveling to?
Speaker 2:
No, we're just here in the US, I mean, uh, California, mostly, um, and then, um, uh, and then, you know, just back and forth between Virginia and here, uh, where my sister lives. We're going to Miami next weekend, so, you know, just uh. Yeah, it's just a family because we have family in town, so we've been like, you know, just traveling with them.
Speaker 1:
Right on. Well, soak up some uh sun for me while you're down there.
Speaker 2:
Thanks. I mean, today is not too bad actually, uh, here in DC as well. Are you, are you in the, in DC right now?
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I'm right over at our office in Union Market.
Speaker 2:
OK. All right, I see. OK. So, uh, thank you first of all for your patience. Uh, I know that, you know, that you've been following up. Uh, we didn't get a chance to, uh, to really discuss things in detail. Um, and, and yeah, and I did see the contract, like, I mean, just just came through it. Um, mainly the question that we had, yeah, as I had asked over the text was, um, About the exit, right? Uh, I understand that, you know, this model is, um, I, I mean the revenue model for your company is to, is, is a long term model, right? That, you know, after 5 years once the payback period starts, is when the company really starts making the, making money, right? Yeah. So, um, the, now I just wanted to do like a couple of hypothetical scenarios with you and see how it's going to work out, right? Uh, the, the first thing is which I asked over the texts, like, you know, let's say if we don't. Live in this house long term and if we end up selling the space, maybe like 56 years down the road, um, what we, and if the new buyer comes in and they're like, you know, we don't need this, um, you know, the, the solar system or we would like to install our own 1st, 1st of all, like how would That work out. So that's my first question.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, so the, the hypothetical scenario where someone wants to buy your house, but they don't want the solar system that's on your house. So there's a couple points in this agreement where you can actually have it removed for no cost, and that's at the 20 year mark, 25 year mark, or 30 mark, but if you're gonna move out before 20 years, then it's like, oh wait, I don't want to pay for, you know, these solar panels to removed be removed if this new person doesn't want it, um, for I forget exactly what your system size was, but it wasn't too big. If they didn't, um, and I can. I can get you an exact answer. What was your address again?
Speaker 2:
5325 5th Street Northwest.
Speaker 1:
So we had a system for See And this was panels. OK, 21 panels. And uh what you'll see in there too, I'm just gonna write that down, 21 panels. Cost of removing. Um, and reinstall. Wow. I'd say if the new people uh want to buy your house, but they don't want to buy the or not buy, but like if they don't want to have the solar panels on that, they could pay like 500 bucks and we'll come out and we'll move, and I'm not sure. Exactly, um. What your home is worth, but if it's like 1500 bucks to do the removal. It's like, you'll add a 0.25% uh maybe to your home uh sale price, and they could have them removed. I, I've never seen someone do it cause it's gonna like increase their electric costs, um, but it can be done like really cheaply and, you know. That's the as long as it's well, so as it you couldn't do that um before 5 years too. So if you are in that find yourself in that situation, um, and you're moving like let's say 2 years from now and you got panels up there, then they wouldn't have the option to pay that like $1500 or so uh for them to remove it, um, they have to, you'd have to find someone who uh wants to have the panels on the roof.
Speaker 2:
OK, so it has to be, so the thinner box is It has to be like after 5 year mark, right? Mhm. OK. OK. Um, OK, now the other scenario is that and the the reason why I asked this is because, you know, for two reasons. One is that You know, people, uh, one is that, you know, it'll be tied to the house, which means that, you know, it will possibly or negatively affect the, you know, the The the sale price, uh, if you may, or, or, or like, you know, it could be factored into the decision of like buying or selling the house, right? Now, the, the other thing is that, you know, if if a buyer comes in. Or if for example, it's us, you know, who decide that, you know, no, we want to also, like, you know, uh get the returns from the, from the asset itself, right? Which means, which would require us acquiring the panels from the company, right? Or, you know, the uh the next person who comes in after us, they may ask that. Is there a provision for that as well? Yes.
Speaker 1:
So at that same 5 year mark, and that that's about when they've made their money back and that's why things are way more flexible at that time. So at that 5 year mark you would have an option to purchase it.
Speaker 2:
OK. And is there, uh, do we have like a price point for that? Like what it's going to look like after 5 years?
Speaker 1:
No, we don't. The price actually and in the contract it's, it'll be reviewed by a third party inspector, um, so that is fair, and I can't really say like what it would be like, you know, each year, but it's like, you know. There are other investor that we actually put the majority of our projects through, they're more flexible with that. They don't have that like 5 year cut off, and it's like you could buy it like if you do free solar and then a year later you could decide to buy it and we'll facilitate that. Probably won't be a great deal cause they haven't really made much money back on it yet. Um, does that kind of make sense with, with like how they.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it does. I mean, at that point they'll just be breaking even, so, uh, and, you know, given the opportunity. Is there? Is there a monthly payment? No, we, we, no. We don't pay anything, right? Correct, for free just looking under section 3A and 3B. OK, in the contract?
Speaker 1:
Let me pull it up
Speaker 2:
too. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
cause it definitely mentions like the contract definitely mentions a payment you have to pay and a power price you have to pay. And on the first page of it, those are defined as 0. So it's like, you know, there's like weird in it where it's like, hey, if you don't pay the monthly payment, you're gonna, you're gonna have to pay the $5 late fee. Well, if you find a way how to not pay us $0 for it, then they charge you a late fee, um, but it's all 0 now.
Speaker 2:
How, how, how does one not pay $0? Like under what circumstances would that happen? Um. So the monthly payment would be set at 0 on the 1st 1st page. Mhm.
Speaker 1:
And towards the bottom, it like even more clearly, uh it, I think it has it listed like 7 times like at the bottom of the contract page it's like, hey, the total payments on this are $0 the total of like this.
Speaker 2:
Should be, I think it should be in exhibit A because that's a reference I see somewhere. It should be in exhibit A, if I'm not mistaken, or if you could please guide us towards like exactly to the page. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
let me pull up, um, let me pull up a blank example. And then I can probably share my screen too. And I think I just either. I think I either just downloaded this or I just sent it to someone. Let's go here. OK, get in the DocuSign.
Speaker 2:
When I see the lease disclosures and which is exhibit A, uh, a lot of these fields are empty, um. So we don't really have. We don't really have any, so, OK, I'm just trying to understand the would you be updating this contract before we sign it because it requires us to sign, but then a lot of fields are empty. So we don't know what we'll be signing on.
Speaker 1:
Yep, I'm pulling it up on my end uh and just. Do you like tests
Speaker 2:
or.
Speaker 1:
Let's try that. OK.
Speaker 2:
And
Speaker 1:
Uh And let me share my screen here.
Speaker 2:
Cool.
Speaker 1:
Right. You see my screen all right?
Speaker 2:
Yep. Awesome.
Speaker 1:
OK. So we kind of go through this. So on the first page, um, it should have your monthly payment and guaranteed rate listed as 0.
Speaker 2:
OK, right now it's blank. There there's nothing in there. It's
Speaker 1:
blank. OK. So I know they did. I just ran into this with someone who was trying to do this last night. If it isn't uh zeroed out, or like, let me have you checked the other one. I'll send you a different one where there's uh zeros on everything.
Speaker 2:
Right. Because so far, yeah, everything is blank. OK,
Speaker 1:
so like,
Speaker 2:
yeah, almost like it's a template, uh, which, yeah, yeah, I think. System size also like is that something you fill in later?
Speaker 1:
So the system size and production, that is what gets filled in later cause we haven't done all the measurements on your roof yet, so they'll go back and they'll countersign it with the correct system size and production, but that should be zeroed out before um any of that happens, and then they just go back and fill out the system size and production. I just ran into this last night cause they I believe they reset it um for the template and I was like, hey, it should be all zeros and then uh my year was like, hey, no, it's not like that. I'm like, OK, let me, so it looks like this littles like that too, um, let me send you a different one. And actually I can go in and correct it. So, let me discard that draft. Go into
Speaker 2:
yours.
Speaker 1:
go crap.
Speaker 2:
Oh, yes, yeah. Oh. Number 6. OK. Oh So I think it should be fun. Yeah.
Speaker 1:
Is this uh is this the right phone number for you?
Speaker 2:
Yep, yep. Mhm.
Speaker 1:
OK, great.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I just declined any like uh SMS updates. Oh yeah wanted to keep it on uh on email.
Speaker 1:
Oh, that's OK. Um, when I'm correcting it, it might like walk you out of it while I'm correcting it. So, OK. Like that. And then I'm just gonna put zeros for all those fields.
Speaker 2:
OK, that's fine. I mean, you, you can send it to us uh later as well. Um, now, where where's the section? Which section? There's a section, customer obligation, what, what uh section was it? Oh, I'm password. Customer obligations 6.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, uh, page 6.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, let me just open it on my end as well. Um, Can you tell me the page number? Mhm. 9 of 27. Well, it's 6. 9 OK, so this is a section 4 customer obligations, um. Subsection 6 says you're either a citizen or legal permanent resident of the United States or not otherwise exempt from paying United States federal income taxes. Now, these are, uh, we are both co-signatories on the, on the mortgage, Sana, my wife, she's a US citizen. I'm not. I work for the World Bank and I I'm actually exempt from the federal income taxes because of my visa status. G4 visa, which is like a diplomatic visa, does not, uh, so under that visa, uh, you know, uh, and the regulation, uh, I'm actually not obligated to pay federal income taxes. Now, how will that factor in?
Speaker 1:
Um, we would just put it in her name, and then They probably wouldn't even care if uh you did um put it in your name cause they're not checking like, hey, they're checking if you're the homeowner and if you're on city records and that's check, um, so like, yeah, that's in there. They're not like, you know, like pulling people's like legal records and checking who's a citizen or not, but if you did keep compliant with that, we can just put it in your wife's name and then that will get around that.
Speaker 2:
OK. Um, All right, I see that. Uh, what is the initial term that is being referred to here? There's a
Speaker 1:
Initial term. Believe it puts it at. The first page, it's 20 years.
Speaker 2:
OK.
Speaker 1:
So that's where you'll see a lot of mentions to like, hey, at the end of 20 years or like any reference to like initial terms 20 years, and then uh you can renew that term for in 25 year increments uh so you can get 30 years of all the warranties and free power and everything.
Speaker 2:
OK. Now, The back to my, um, back to my initial question about the, about the exit and again, you know, I keep asking this because we're not looking to get into this agreement to exit it, but like, you know, you should always like with every business document, you know, there should be these terms should be clear. Um, so for, for the exit, you said that. Uh, the fee option, the $15 fee option is going to be available to us after 5 years, right?
Speaker 1:
The for like if you're
Speaker 2:
if if we were to remove the system, let's say, or if we move and the next person comes in and says, I don't want to keep the system, so if you want to have it removed, that has to be after 5 years you said, right? Mhm. OK, but in on page one, where there's uh like you know the the condition specifically specific to like moving, it says transfer this agreement to the home buyer, right? That's straightforward, but then it says pay a fee and we will remove the system, right? Now, when we say pay a fee, uh there are two things that should be incorporated into the contract. One, what that fee is. And then secondly, also to clarify that this will only be applicable after 5 years because right now it's, it's unclear, at least on the first page, unless it's, unless it elaborates, uh, the contract elaborates on that elsewhere.
Speaker 1:
It's, it's specified elsewhere. Let me find those two spots. And the first one. So they wouldn't be able to give you like a hey, it's gonna be this exact amount because they also haven't determined the uh system size and so the inspection is complete, but they do give you a rate per panel. And that is on page 11 right here. Yeah. So this most often comes up in the uh like if you're doing a re-roof um and we're taking the panels off and doing the roof, putting them back on, and here it says 6 years as well, um, forgive me if I misspoke on the 5 years, the ROI construction contract, the other installer we use a lot of the other ones that's standard is 5 years. Um, but I may have done a year off on that one. OK. When we do So let's see, transfer, purchase in connection with the transfer of your property that occurs anytime after 6 years after the activation date, you may purchase system by paying us to the purchase option price at that time.
Speaker 2:
I look Like Maybe we can just get like um finish yeah finish up all yours. No, I'm just finishing up saying something.
Speaker 1:
Um, right here is where it defines that cost. So if you like to have the solar system removed anytime after the six years, this fee is reduced to $150 per solar panel plus any applicable taxes. So,
Speaker 2:
But that would be more than $1500 as you said earlier, because 21 panels, 21 panels, that's going to be more than $3000.
Speaker 1:
So you're taking them off, um, you're just doing the removal and and not doing like the labor for the double labor for like removing and putting them back on like in the re-roof example. Um, transfer renewal. You may like to have the system removed and pay us a fee equal to the default payment. Within 6 years after the expiration dates. So if you remove it before the, like if you're moving before the 6 years and you're in this situation where the new people don't want the panels on there, then. There would be a cost to remove them. But it also be pay us a fee equal to the default payment, so it's like, If you do it before 6 years, then it's like that sounds like you're kind of buying the system, um, if it's before the 6 years, but if you're in the situation after the 6 years. And if you like to have the system removed anytime after the 6 years, after the activation date, this fee is reduced to $150 per solar panel, uh, plus tax. What is it?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, so that's, that's the part which is not clear. Um, we don't know what it's going to be before. Yeah, I mean, after it's clear, it's like 150 per panel plus applicable taxes and if you're talking about 21 uh panels, that would be uh 3150 plus applicable taxes. Um, but if we do before that, it'll be even higher, which is, um, because, um, initially you said that it's going to be 1500, so I'm. Just a little confused there, the what the exact amount, what the amount is exactly going to be. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
before the 6 years since they haven't made all your money back or all their money back, the default payment, that's like You would have to buy out of like that amount of of money. So like, let's say for like another hypothetical, let's say you do free solar and then you get installed and then like a month later you're like, hey, I wanna buy this system. Well, You'd probably pay 100% of the cost cause it just got installed, and then like a year after that it'll probably depreciate a little bit and then it's like, OK, if you're in this situation a year after you get free solar, then it's like you'll pay whatever the depreciation of a year is.
Speaker 2:
Yeah,
Speaker 1:
they make their money back, so
Speaker 2:
that's, that's fine. I mean, I, I, I, I get the principle of it, but we don't, uh, still don't know the number. Uh, what, what is that liability that we are talking about, so. You know,
Speaker 1:
before the 6 years is up, and you're
Speaker 2:
like. Before and after, both, yeah. After 150 solar panel. Yeah, after 150, so that's clear. So that's 3150 plus taxes. What about before?
Speaker 1:
Before that value of like, OK, where's the date on like if it's like Um, like shortly after you get the system installed versus like maybe a year or two until you're getting towards the 6 years, that's where I said they'd have a third party, uh, inspector come out and they would determine their market value of what that system is worth. What
Speaker 2:
right. But we can still, we, we can still exactly we can still get a, get an indicative number on that because, you know, you would definitely know the initial cost of set up, right? So on day zero, that is the liability, right? That's the max liability that we'll be under, uh, and then we can, you know, maybe you can tell us what the average depreciation for uh for solar panels is, but I think it's a It has a 20-year lifetime, so we can assume that there's a 5% depreciation each year and based on that, we can work backwards, but if we, but it'll be really helpful if we have a base number to work with.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, and that that's kind of the hard part because the the costs of these systems like it, it can change on install day like what the cost is. Like recently it's uh it's a lot colder outside and like the other installer we use a lot, they use like an adhesive. Mounting bracket and it takes a day for it to dry when it's cold out. So our labor cost is for an additional day, and it's like sometimes we we don't know what the project will cost until that day, like install day. The investor, I can tell you what the investor, like the funding that the investor will like a lot for it cause
Speaker 2:
if it's A, yeah, some ballpark and, you know, we can, we, we can work the variance from there. I mean, I'm pretty sure it's not going to be like, you know, 10,000 today and 100,000 on installation day, right? I mean, the, the, it, it still will be in a, in a ballpark. So if you can get that ballpark. That would be helpful. And I think it's uh uh for the comfort of homeowners, I think it'll be nice to have that um. You know, incorporated in the contract somewhere where we can say that this is the max value, this max liability that you'll be under, um, because
Speaker 1:
there's, so there's zero liability. So this is only like if you choose to to do like if you these weird scenarios, like otherwise your liability is zero, the cost, the cost of the system would be. Uh, they would allot roughly $27,000 for the funding in this project. Mhm. And Like that, for example, like, hey, if you get um on top of your roof and like start smashing every single panel and break everything and like you gotta replace everything, it'd be like a $27,000 you'd have to pay to fix everything if you broke everything.
Speaker 2:
Got it. All right, so that's, that's a max liability. I mean, um, ballpark
Speaker 1:
if only if you're one in one of these weird situations that,
Speaker 2:
right, right, right before 6 years, 6 years, right, so. So for 6 years, I think it'll be like roughly 5% depreciation every year and Uh, actually, no. It won't be 5%. I don't know how they work the depreciation if they work it by payback period or if they work by if they work it by the useful life of the solar panel, uh, I'm not entirely sure. Um, but I think if it's the, if the payback period is 5 years, then it should be 20% annual, which means that, you know, 20%, they're recovering 20% of their cost each year, right? Um, I'm, I'm assuming that, um, the other thing is that since you mentioned damage to the solar panels, these would be insured, right? Like there's a warranty 2, 25 year warranty, I mean for like uh any extreme weather events, something like that, they're covered.
Speaker 1:
Yes, there's two things like categories. So like the first you mentioned is like, like let's say a hurricane comes through, it damages it or a tree falls on it, or there's like a massive hailstorm. Those are like acts of God and
Speaker 2:
Right. Earthquakes, flooding, fires, all of that, right? Of
Speaker 1:
the apocalypse and um. And the other thing is like if a, if you have a defective panel, if the production is lower than what they're guaranteeing the production will be, if the inverter goes out. You know, any of those things like maintenance or workmanship, those things are all covered too, and that's why I usually use the example of like getting on your roof and and smashing it. Like if you're, as long as you're not purposely causing damage to the system, then they'll be on the hook for for everything, um,
Speaker 2:
yeah. All right, that's helpful and um, OK, uh so we have, so maybe we'll get like a revised contract now. Yeah. And then um In in your experience, what is the best time of the year to get these installed like so that we don't, I understand that, you know, nowadays because it's super cold. It'll probably be like. More difficult challenging with like labor costs and everything. Yeah, I'm just, yeah.
Speaker 1:
Usually around now is uh the best time of year to get the process started because the summer bills are usually the highest for everyone unless you have like uh electric heat system and you're using more in the winter. I do see that sometimes, but when I go back to your usage, so it's like. You, you moved in in like August?
Speaker 2:
Um, yeah, mid July, August, yeah.
Speaker 1:
OK. I would, I know we don't have a whole year usage, but I would guess your usage in the summer is gonna be when it's the highest cause it's kind of going down on the slope here. So I would say 3 to 4 months is a good expectation for install timeline. So it's like it's end of January now, we have February, March, April, uh, so we'll be looking at like May probably for install. I usually tell people like right now they are enrolling right now, like, hey figure on like June or July, um, but by summertime you should probably have your panels installed and turned on, uh, right as your bills are getting to the highest point, and That's how for most people it'll it'll line up. Um, however, PEPCO can always throw a wrench in it and do all this back and forth. I did have like A handful of clients that I like uh I worked with about 150 people last year and maybe 2 or 3 had like very long timelines for whatever reason, like someone signed up in March and then they didn't get installed till December cause there was all this back and forth with PEPCO. There were a couple other projects that PEPCO just completely disqualified, and at the end of the day it is, it is up to them um with what happens with if you're actually allowed to do this or not, and Uh, I do let people know that cause like I never want to promise someone like hey, it's gonna be on your roof, uh, this month, and then like Pepco throws a wrench in it, but, um, just to set expectations I mentioned that, um, if everything goes plan, uh you should have them on your roof and pretty soon free power by the summertime.
Speaker 2:
OK. There's one more thing I'm just looking at the image now, um. We did, I think when you did the initial mapping, I think the there were events that didn't let you install all of them in sync. Um,
Speaker 1:
Oh yeah, these ones.
Speaker 2:
Yeah.
Speaker 1:
And that's what we'll check out on the inspection. That's why they don't put a system size on there cause these ts, a lot of times we can put them over like this, and if you do like a good racing system, sometimes it doesn't matter, but there was like one client I set up and it's like we could do them on all those vents but not over that vent. So we had to take a panel or two off and like try to rework around them. And if the design changes significantly, like if it's more than like, you know, if we have to take stuff off the design because there's uh panels or there's something we didn't see on, you know, from satellite on my end, then we have to let you know cause it'll be a different like amount of panels, um,
Speaker 2:
yeah. All right. Sounds good. Um, is it, uh, um, can we, uh, have someone come in and inspect before we like, you know, lock in everything? No. No, because that would change the, the base cost, right? And before getting into. Before committing to, yeah,
Speaker 1:
yeah. They, they really only want to work with people that are are serious about getting the the free system and we're doing way too many of these right now to um just be giving free inspections to to people that may not.
Speaker 2:
I know the reason why I say this is little to do with like how serious or not serious one is, but to have full information before we sign any paperwork, you know, because we don't know, like I said that, you know, first it was going to be $27,000 worth of investment, but if there's, if the number of panels change, that could also significantly change the that investment, hence. Underlying liability for us as well. So I hope they can also appreciate that no one wants to, like, you know, get into a long term commitment before knowing exactly what they're signing up for.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, and that's why the the free program is so good, and that's why almost no one purchases it because the free program is the least possible liability you can take. You're not paying anything for it and we'll never collect your payment. Information unless you're you're breaking it yourself. Yeah, there could be different costs uh associated with the job, but that's all not on you unless you, you put yourself in one of these weird situations where it's like, like you're breaking the system yourself or if you're like deciding to take off the panels and, and going back to paying Pepko before the 6 years. I've never seen that happen. I've never seen it. Not able to sell their home because they had panels on it. Um
Speaker 2:
OK. Sounds good. All right. So we will look forward for the updated contract and then we can, um, you know, we'll, we'll go through it comprehensively, sign it, return it, and then we can decide on a. You know, on a mutual time when we can initiate the process. Does that sound good to you?
