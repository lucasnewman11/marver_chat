Speaker 1:
Oh, hey there, Matt. This is Martin over at Sustainable You. Good afternoon.
Speaker 2:
How's it going?
Speaker 1:
It's going pretty good. Uh, we're the ones doing the free solar. I was just curious, have you guys taken advantage of that program?
Speaker 2:
Not yet. OK,
Speaker 1:
got you. You might have seen what happened in the news with the new administration, but basically what they did is they, they paused all the funding for the inflation Reduction Act, so the federal government pays about 30% of the whole solar costs. So if you were to purchase the system, you wouldn't get that 30%, but free solar still exists, uh for now, so we're just looking to help the people out who know about the program, do it before anything might change on that side of it. Does that make sense? Yeah, that makes sense. Cool. Um, um, Paul asked me to reach out to everybody. I was curious, did he ever get to sit down with you and show you, you know, what it looks like and answer any questions you had or just talk to you about it?
Speaker 2:
Yeah,
Speaker 1:
he
Speaker 2:
did? Mhm. OK,
Speaker 1:
cool. Um, is this something you'd like to revisit?
Speaker 2:
Uh, just not at this time right now, but, um. It's kind of a bad time. Oh,
Speaker 1:
I get, I get it. I mean, for the whole, yeah, yeah, for everybody here in DC, yeah, not, not great, um, yeah, uh, when can I put you down for like a follow-up date, you know, just to get an answer, uh,
Speaker 2:
early next month.
Speaker 1:
Early next month, about
Speaker 2:
22 to 3 weeks.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I can do that. I can, I can set it up for 2 weeks. I can give you a call then. Um, while you have me on the, on the line here, do you have any questions, comments, concerns for me or about the whole process?
Speaker 2:
Uh, no, no, not right
Speaker 1:
now.
Speaker 2:
OK.
Speaker 1:
Got you. No worries. Well, this is my personal number. You can reach out to me or Paul at any time. We're always, we're always here for you.
Speaker 2:
I appreciate it.
Speaker 1:
Thanks. Bye
