Speaker 1:
Oh hey there, Michelle. This is Martin over attainable. Good afternoon. Hi, are you? I'm with we're the ones doing the solar. I was just curious, have you guys been able to take advantage of that yet? Oh, perfect. How do you like?
Speaker 2:
Um, they're not producing, but I'm hopeful.
Speaker 1:
Uh, when did you guys get installed?
Speaker 2:
Uh, the end of December.
Speaker 1:
End of December. OK, so yeah, um, that we're waiting for Pepco to allow them to turn it on. Um, so it takes that takes about like 4 to 6 weeks. So give it just a little bit more time, and they will turn on its remotely, I believe, after they get approval for it, and they will start producing for you. Thank you. Yup. Any other questions or comments, concerns I can take care of while you got me? No, that's it. OK, perfect. Um, yeah, uh, uh, cool, thanks. Have a good one. Bye
