Here is the conversation formatted with speakers indicated:


Representative: Yeah, I mean, it was, you know, I worked for a couple of people off the Northwest, and I think back then it was like $50,000 but if you got free electricity. From that point on. Then it was work, yeah. And that's where, you know, it's like, hey, you can still do that. You can go out and buy a $350,000 solar system and there's like some cool incentives you get, but it's like almost no one has that line around and the interest rates are like. Not great either. So it's like if you, I tell people, hey, if you can swing the purchase, do it. There's some cool incentives, but what probably about 90% of my clients do is the free program, and that's where sustainable our organization comes in. We set this program up about 2-3 years ago and uh they pay for everything and you just get the free power.


Client: If I send you say free power how much are we talking about? Am I gonna have a free electricity bill or I'm only getting a percentage?  


Representative: That's your question. So it depends house to house and it depends on how much you're using on the electric bill. Do you know like what your highest usage is usually or like what your highest bill is in there?


Client: No, I. Uh, if you have a bill, that'd be really helpful. I was gonna say probably a highest bill would be right under 3. Uh, You have I like everything else is doing that.


Representative: Yeah, oh, we can't do anything about the water unfortunately, but you know what, I'm talking about when we got married 30 years ago and I had my house, we had this house. And we would compare bills and the water bill would we would get get I think 3 months. 3 months.  


Client: Yeah let me see We get a lot of baby now and stuff like that. You got a little. every 3 months $40.


Representative: Well, yeah, I wore the other day is what like 200, about 100. 


Client: every month. On the, on the electric side last year around this time last year, the average electric rate in DC was like about 15 or so cents and then now it's like 18.5, so it like went up a couple cents and it's like they passed a $100 they asked for a $190 million increase last year, they got approved for a $124 million increase this year. So it's tripled over the past 20 years, but it's not just gonna triple over the next 20. They have to upgrade the grid. Oh yeah, I didn't know if that was like the


Client: Mhm you wanna see something crazy. This is.


Representative: Mm I don't have no 00, I didn't not see that. Yeah, Apple mix I know I OK Yeah, it's probably the other side I think. So do you have the I can so Wait, what, uh, full, full off hours here and the first one. Yeah, I think I just asked, uh, do you, do you have electric heat here? 


Client: No.


Representative: It up. Do you use like electric heaters at all?


Client: Oh, OK. That will do it. Your usage is a lot of people it'll go like up in, it'll go like up in the summer and down in the winter.


Client: Pretty much all over the time. Yes because it's so cold.


Representative: Mhm


Client: Mhm, I put it on.


Representative: Mhm. I have a 10 kgs for the.


Client: Mm Yeah I totally like I mean. So thingy I feel I uh. I mean, and still I'm running the.


Representative: OK, do you have to run it to what you saw. 


Client: Yeah, 3, yeah. 50, 16,000 kiatt hours.  


Representative: Mhm yeah. And which looks like Looks like that was more than the year before. You put to uh come through on here. So 263. You said that he How much she increasedent on electricity since January 2001. I don't, I don't even try to get. You know


Client: Oh no he said how much do you think?


Representative: Oh yeah, we don't have to do you know what I, I was thinking I wonder. Cheaper that there was. Well, 20 years ago the average was about 6 or 7 cents, and yeah, so if you're using 16,000 kilowatt hours in a year and you follow the uh rates that have gone up since 2001, you spent about $46,000 or whoever's um. Uh, then in the home has spent that much on the electricity, uh, assuming the usage hasn't changed too much. The problem is, um, that rate, if the rate of change is a little over 4% a year, keeps going how it does, you're not just gonna spend $46,000 in the next 30 years, you're just spend over $100,000 on power if the rate of change doesn't change. And that's why they um push clean energy uh so much here because it helps a lot and. Helps everyone. So your, your benefit with the preprogram, right, is you get all the power from the system for free and I'll find out in fact how much that would affect your bill. But you don't have to pay anything, you'll never have any payment information to us, there's no credit check, there's no income requirement, none of that.


Client: So what happens if I have to do something on my roof where I have to do the roof repair or something like that? Who's to to move those panels?


Representative: Great question. The, so CMU, part of my organization, we are partnered with pretty much all the installers in DC. The one that I've done for some insults around here, and most of the insoles we do is a roofer. So what we do is we come out, we take the panels off, we do the roof for you, and put the panels back on. There's a, it obviously isn't for you to pay someone to take the panels off, but because we're there for both projects, usually it doesn't end up being more expensive than the, um, like a roof without the panel, the roof without the panels. And I would just say like, hey, for those 30 years of free power, um, just that section, probably just like one of those years of savings we'll go to paying for the um removal and reinstall costs.


Client: So, so you're saying that, that y'all will pay for that?


Representative: No, I would have to pay it back. And that's the best part, cause like you're not gonna have to pay much more than an actual work.


Client: So you're talking about 20,000 miles.


Representative: No, oh no, no, no, no, no, it's like no, no, no, every group around here. Oh, no, to remove the, right, how much would it cost about he said no need to have a roof repaired, maybe no more than 10%. 10% or what like extra than like what a normal roof cost, but it's like I don't know what kind of roof you have. I don't know


Client: Mhm and if you do have a, OK.


Representative: And that's totally fine and like it also depends on how many panels you have because it's like a bigger system or if there's like a different rapping model that's used like that's a good question to ask because you wanna make sure it's gonna be like good for you. You know like you don't want like hidden costs, right?


Client: Right, got you. So, um, we try our goal is to make that process as easy as possible for you. So whenever you you need a roof redone in the future, we just have the installer do it because they're also a roofer. They usually get like a good deal on the roof because they're making their money from the solar and usually all balances out. About how long does a needles? They last about 34 years.


Representative: Yeah, do you know when you had your last one replaced?


Client: Oh, so good to go. That's not something you have to worry about like 20 years from now. Well it's still, it's gotta be coded. That's why I'm asking questions because it's still gotta be coded, yeah, it still gotta be treated.


Representative: Oh no go. We do codings all the time. Those are easy, um, and we can usually get funding from this program to cover those costs. So if it needs a coding or if you want like a stupid good deal on a roof coating before the panels go up, just to like max out that extension of the life on the roof, I don't think that'd be a bad idea. And.


Client: Yeah about 15 months. Let me see what How many pounds of Because we work with a roofer, uh, because we work with a roof. Well, I have, I, I have a roofer. I know, but what I pay to have this put on, there's no way that you could that that can do it for that price. For only 20 g, this would be like 8 or 90 if you pay 200 for 20 grand for it I'm just saying that's what the average group the estimates that I've got has been up to like 18 to 20, a little bit more than 20 depending on.


Representative: I with a bigger company but the person that I went with for for my roof. 


Client: Uh, we're not. No, no, no, for the root they're taking 20 g we got. That's if you go, if you go like, um, well, I didn't do it, but my neighbor that street was long as long and since they went to 29,000. And so what they told her is that if you sign a day we'll knock off 10,000. So I told her, you know, they were trying to screw you from the beginning. If you tell me, and that's, this is, this is the way I think, if you tell me, well, Mr. Davis said, if you sign a day I can knock off 100, that means you're trying to screw me in front of the beginners, you know, so I, I don't want to. I I don't wanna deal with you at all, you know, I don't care if you go down to 5. I don't wanna deal with you because you already showed me the differential, right, so this is now, yeah, yeah, no, what I was what I was gonna say though is that because the solar panels that we have are also when they do they're very sensitive to not doing it in a way that does we let's say if I went with your panels we gonna have a. We're gonna have a situation because they redo this house that door and so our roofs overlap, you know what I mean, we got a prayer wall in between, but Um, I gave him permission to overlap or to. Make sure that that therapy wall didn't leak, you know, so I don't know if, I mean they really can't have no issue because we, we go whatever that wall is we can go have the distance in that wall, you know, um. Um,


Representative: So probably right. And what I do for um all my clients. So one reason, one of the things that that installer does. they use a mounting practice that is zero root penetrations they go from wall to walls. So uh so yeah. They do it uh direct now, so you can do it wall to wall and put the. Like you could go like. You can be You could do it like this. Mm. This is how it would be with beans and like you see so I put it on there and you get this system that. This one like that, and then they can use like half of the from the walls, and they went over half the food. Well on this wall is all right if they had to because this is my this my wall goes all the way up the house over here doesn't it stops showing way showing. Well that's they still go halfway because I didn't prevent your neighbor from being the rails. I get done for here.


Client: Well, that's what I'm saying over here, this house is a smaller house, so this house probably. Next door probably only go up maybe to my the top to this to this group here and as far as the house goes so this no here we got the same wall. So this is one of the um. We had a root over.


Representative: And I just wanna show you why I think that 20 grand is crazy because we would do a full roof over. So I said like 7 or 8 grand would be more standard. They're taking like over 100s of profit like when they're quoting them out. says the code the code, the code we have to quote it. I can try to find one that's like similar, but that's one that like we can um. Like they, they probably do it for you for like $50. 


Client: I got the price of 9.


Representative: No We can get down to that for sure.


Client: So so let me so let's get back to the panel. So we, we put the panels up there. What is it gonna cut my electricity?  


Representative: Yeah, I like a lot. I mean because like right now.


Client: I So I just take 2 months. But when I'm chewy, my daughter and him, they're not chewy. Do you think does the house like that, uh, ventilate for your wall? I know some people that travel with like, oh, it's like always gets really warm here, but I can never get it warm here.


Representative: Yeah, it gets really warm upstairs. You


Client: Mhm. I mean there's areas that like back here there's no heat back there because that that used to be a back porch so there's no heat, the heat stops here. So if I close this door and that door over there, it would heat up pretty good.


Representative: Did you guys the top from the porch?


Client: Yeah, it was converted from a screen in porch to where we didn't, it was done way before. We got here. Almost done So you know the you know the size of the house?


Representative: It looks like Um, I could find out. I know the, I know the I know roughly the dimensions of the stops of the pants would go. Um


Client: There have been complaints about. Um, where the panels are, like when it rains heavy, or heavy.


Representative: Only, only on um a frameworks that have problems. A frame because on a frame they deal that they drill directly into the shingles. And the ones that go to houses go like this, they have problems. No that's why the solar set thing I mentioned is uh really good because we make uh with that design. He Even Um, we can only do the zero risk penetration. On what?


Client: Yeah, I've seen people get uh solar panels put on and the roof.  


Representative: Yeah, and then, uh, one lady, she had solar panels on and she went, they took them off, they took them off for free for her to get a new roof put on, and then when they went to put them back on, they charged her they want to charge you like $1400 to the panel back on, you know, so.


Client: And that's pretty standard. I know that like some companies like that might have been solar solution um like they used to have uh like hey we'll come out like one time. 


Representative: Yeah, 13. The reroute. I don't, there are some consolers we're not partnered with, but I'm not aware of anyone who does that. And that's like the benefit that they like go down at the time and that's where like it'll just continue. 


Client: How long were those males of both the legs? That's really good part too and also like on equipment and practices and stuff because I know you don't wanna um into some of those situations they passed the sustainable 2.0 DT plan and they actually managed it the type of equipment that we put on and how we do it and it takes like this stuff but even if you really wanna get solder, like you gotta wait like months to get it because you gotta go through all the permitting and regulations and make sure.


Representative: But if we have the wrong color zip ties or if we have a sticker like image somewhere they like it to be but they redo everything so it's like extended how long it takes to get these done, but more people get a better, uh, product and service and less of those issues back from like the wild west of things to do. And To answer your question on What to. And I That half is electric. 263. It So this year 2030, they signed about $3000 in electric if the rates don't go up, so they passed a $124 million dollar rate increase, so it'll go up maybe like 150 cents to say 18, so at least $3000. This system would produce like just over that. Let me show you. So you have these masks based on your root, if you fill up the whole thing. You know That's the production and it's like 40 hours above what you're using, so you would get. 100% of your electric charges covered. You still gotta pay the the customer fee, the um Pepco fee like you won't get a zero bill, but it'll go down to $16 to go down $16. It'll go down to $16 plus like whatever the tax it'll go down to $16 plus whatever they're charging you.


Client: Well, that, that if you get all your electric, uh, covered, if it all balances out, the only net thing that you'll pay is the customer charge because all the other fees are charges now. 1608, but what if they got,
