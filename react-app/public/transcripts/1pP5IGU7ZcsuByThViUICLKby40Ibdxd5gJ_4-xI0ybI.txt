Speaker 1:
23
Speaker 2:
months. But uh yeah, have
Speaker 1:
have you all ever looked into like programs for solar before we just moved in, so we've been busy trying to arrange other stuff, but um we're we're really interested in getting some information. Yeah, well that
Speaker 2:
that's exactly what we'll do. I'll um I'll keep pretty open ended and for exploratory. Um, well, what I'll do right now is I'm gonna pull up your address and just see like, hey, what's the, the viability for your roof like how many, you know, panels will fit up there, and we can put in your electric usage from the PEPCO bill. Um, if you've been here since June, you'll have like the, the highest months like for the summers
Speaker 1:
that we have. Oh, right there.
Speaker 2:
OK, sweet. Cool. I will put in the address and what number you to sign. Do you know like how much your highest bill was like what you spent on it? right there OK OK. It looks like
Speaker 1:
July was the highest. October, yeah,
Speaker 2:
that's pretty good.
Speaker 1:
Uh
Speaker 2:
And did you move here from another place in DC or?
Speaker 1:
From southeast, yeah. OK, perfect. Cool.
Speaker 2:
Do you know about the Clean Energy Act that they passed in like 2018?
Speaker 1:
Um, in DC, yeah, we're, I, I read a little bit about it, yeah, so there are incentives to shifts.
Speaker 2:
Oh, big time, yeah, I, I couldn't quote the whole thing, word for word for you, but the important thing that it did is it mandated that 100% of our electric. The District must come from renewable sources by 2032, so it's like 8 years from now. And not only that, all of the 100% of that clean energy, it must be produced in the inside the district like they can't, you know, like ship it in from New Jersey or, you know, solar fields like far away has to be made here. And uh they set fines so that if they don't meet the sole requirement, if they don't meet all the other requirements for clean energy, like PEPCO is gonna have to keep paying money, and it's a lot of money if they don't hit that. And the opposite to that to incentivize them is to get out of that fine is they can help pay. For people's solar systems, so when they help pay for someone's solar system, it offsets the fine, and it's cheaper for them to do that than to pay the fine. So they would love to just, like, you know, build a giant solar field and be done with it, but they don't own, uh, yeah, so pretty much everyone's, uh, roof space just became prime real estate, and because the fines are so high they're paying top dollar to use it to produce energy.
Speaker 1:
So is Pepco working with other companies like yours?
Speaker 2:
Yes, so Pepco, like. The electric company, like, you know, no one from the city is like ever gonna like come out to your house for it. They legally can't recommend a company, but they're the ones paying for it. So whether, you know, our organization to sustainable you, we're, we're not really like the, the solar company, we're more of an advocacy group because what you could do when you want to go solar, what people did like before was like, hey, you can get a quote from Solar Solutions. Or or or or like there's like 60 different installers and they all offer different things and it's like everyone's got a different home so I talked to a lot of people that like kind of started to look into it and then they just got overwhelmed. They didn't know what to do and then they never got solar. It
Speaker 1:
looks big, yeah, I was looking at it like last night and there are a lot of companies and I read some Reddit and like other sources, more reputable sources too, so it seems like a big decision,
Speaker 2:
yeah, yeah, and that's where like our whole goal is. Just to make it really easy and really rewarding to adopt single solutions, whether that's like solar on your roof or we have a bunch of other partnerships like with the rounds and, uh, secretly, we want everyone to just be like super sustainable, but solar is the main thing because it's uh it's free and as long as you own a home in DC and uh have a roof and you know, it's the most impactful thing you can do. It offsets like 30 people's carbon footprint on average in a year. So, um, that's like the main thing we help people out with, but we're partnered with 80% of the installers here. And after doing, we've done about 1600 of these now, uh, we have a really good idea of who's gonna be the best experience for most people. Most of the times it's solar solution, uh, is one that makes sense. If you look online, you'll see them pop up. They've done like, like 6000 installations. You'll see their signs everywhere. They probably have some of your neighbors signed up and insult too, and that's who most of them go through, and it's our job to represent this project to them, and you get a lot of leverage. Because we're not just bringing your job to them, we'd like to bring a new res and like, you know, 70 others in a month. So when you have that, you know, we're bringing them in a group, we can ask for special things. It gets more attention instead of, you know, you can call their like inside sales team. They'll set you up really easy too, but I'm gonna be like personally managing this project to get to install and just make sure that like, you know, you can trust what's going on and you know, just have a really good experience and I'm sure it's not something you want to spend hours and hours and hours doing, right.
Speaker 1:
So if we go through you, you'll be managing our case and then see it through onto installation and later for support. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
and that's where it's like not only before install but like for the lifetime of the system we're gonna be representing everything for you whether that's like, you know, if it ever needs uh something maintained on it or repaired, uh, if you ever move or, uh, you know, need your roof replaced or something then like that's where we're here to help as well.
Speaker 1:
So what's the life expectancy of the system?
Speaker 2:
Great question. It, it can be kind of hard to determine cause like. Um, the. Uh, I'll tell you the warranty. The warranty is 90% output at year 30 as it is in year one. So it would about, yes. So it would degrade about 10% in the next uh 30 years. It's like 1% the first year and then uh throughout the next like 30 years, it'll be about 90% output as year one. So, if it's 90% at year 30, I mean, it's not gonna, you know, drop off the 50% the next year after that, they could be viable on your roof for like 40 or 50 years, and they might be, you know, working longer than than I'm around. So, I usually just tell people 30 years is, you know, a good case for it, but like, you don't need to replace them at your 30.
Speaker 1:
Uh, we, we don't know if we're gonna be alive, um, but that, that sounds good. Um, do you have any questions? So let's say that we, I think our roof was done maybe 2017, and if we were to install something next year or the following year, we, we were not in a situation to do it right away, um, because I, and I'm going to ask questions about that too because, um, I don't think we would like to lease. OK. Um, if we were to go with something, we would rather own our panels rather than lease them to um another. Please, so um. I'm kind of concerned about the political environment and how this program is going to be impacted right now. How firm is the commitment, and I'm sure it's a question you get a lot like in the last week.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, a lot more recently, um, the main thing of concern is like, yeah, hey, our incentives still gonna be here for this. The, the good news is, is, as long as you uh have your application in, you're, you're good. So. The, that's the kind of like, hey, we don't know. Like, for example, the two ways you go solar, you can do the free solar, which is more like the lease route, and then there's the investment option where you can, you can buy it and then you get all the incentives instead of them using the incentives to pay for it. And when you buy it, you're, if you If you do the free one, as long as you submit your application, you're good. It doesn't matter if they change things tomorrow, you'll be fine. They'll still install it, pay for it, everything. If you Purchase it yourself. You The tax credit, um, which is the first incentive. So from the federal government, you'll get 30% of the system back on your taxes, as long as you have the tax liability, which most people do. That's like the only one of concern, and the way that that would go away is if they repeal, they would have to repeal the inflation Reduction Act, which, hey, anything's possible, but the likelihood of that happening is like, We don't really see that as like a likely thing, and they did extend it for like 10 years. It's been around for a while, but like, hey, maybe they find a way to repeal the inflation reduction Act, and like, let's say that 30% goes away, then I'm like, hey, yeah, your system just got, you know, 30% more uh more expensive. The biggest benefit though is the local incentive, the DC incentive, and that's not something that's gonna change on a local level unless they, you know, re-elect everyone in the local, you know, like that passed the Clean Energy Act, and that's kind of why like if there was a Like, long story long, if there was a good chance of these incentives going away, uh, our investors that, you know, they put up millions and millions and millions of dollars to do the free projects, they wouldn't still be buying these systems, if it was, you know, if incentives were gonna go away. Like, they're, they put up the millions of dollars, you know, they're gonna buy the system for people, they'll make all their money back in like 4 or 5 years. Uh, it would be the same for you if you bought it, and then they're gonna profit off it a long time after that. They're not too concerned um about things going away. They wouldn't be purchasing these projects if there was a good chance, yeah.
Speaker 1:
So what is the money equivalent of that 30% tax.
Speaker 2:
It depends on the system size, and I We'll have that for you in just a moment.
Speaker 1:
But just to clarify, yes, it's a 30% rebate.
Speaker 2:
It's not a rebate, it's a non-refundable tax credit,
Speaker 1:
OK, and 30% of what?
Speaker 2:
The
Speaker 1:
total system cost. Annualized. You get it one year after installing it.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, like, let's say your solar system is $30,000. Then when you go to do your taxes the next year, like for my clients that are installed uh before the end of this year, when they go to do their taxes, there's just like a separate form, and it's like, hey, I installed a solar system, it was, you know, X cost $30,000 and then it's times 30%, and then you'd get that back just one time. Is
Speaker 1:
there an income limit on that? No. So it's just a liability question.
Speaker 2:
Liabilities,
Speaker 1:
yes, yes.
Speaker 2:
Do you also, do you know, you said your roof was replaced in 17.
Speaker 1:
Uh, I don't think we know that for a fact. The house was gutted and we made, I think, in 2017, we guess the roof was a part of that.
Speaker 2:
OK.
Speaker 1:
But we're not quite sure. I believe it was earlier. It was. OK.
Speaker 2:
Well, that's why the um when, when you go solar, the first thing that they do after you submit everything is they'll come out and they'll do a roof inspection. So, they'll take pictures, they'll take all the measurements, they'll uh make sure that, you know, it's gonna hold and everything, and then they go from there, we'll submit everything to PECO for approval, and then we'll submit everything to the Department of Buildings, they'll check all our work, make sure your roof's good to go. And uh yeah, after the site survey, if they say your roof's good, then cool, we'll do it and then like, hey, whenever it needs replaced, like, you know, 10, 5, 1015 years from now, we'll come out, we'll take the panels off, do your new roof, put the panels back on, and then go from there. And that's like the ideal situation. Uh, if you, if we come back from the survey and it's like Uh, yeah, it's like getting to the end of its life on the roof. Uh, this one might need a new roof or like a new coating put on it, on it. Uh, there are programs that they'll help you pay for a new roof, and cause there's so much funding for this, like, hey, if we just have to, you know, pay a couple grand to help them get a new roof, cool, we'll do that cause they're gonna be making a ton of money off of it anyway, or if you do the purchase option, they usually just do the roof at cost for you, cause they're already gonna be here for the solar. Yeah. And that's why the, the survey is important too, um, cause also, let's say that uh we come out here and we survey the roof and they're like, You know, this one's gonna need a new roof on it, and then we look at that and then it's like, oh hey, a new roof is gonna be Like way too expensive or something, you know, you're not gonna be in a position where like, if we come out and uh say like, hey, yeah, you gotta do a new roof, like you're not gonna be forced to like buy a new roof, um, we would have to, we would revisit your decision to go solar, and it's like if it needs a roof and we find a way to include it that, you know, makes you guys happy then, you know, you can proceed with that. If you're like, hey, you know, solar is great, but we don't wanna, you know, mess with the new roof right now and you don't have to proceed.
Speaker 1:
But it's always best to get the roof done before installing the system, I'm guessing because it would be really difficult to remove them, right?
Speaker 2:
Um, it's pretty like taking them on and off again, it's it's pretty standard. Um, it's not like a huge process, like the actual insulation, um, which is, uh, which is harder, it's like more involved that that'll do that in like a day or like, like half a day, it will go up. Yeah. So it's, it's usually not a huge process to Uh, do the, do the re-roof and like you'll do it cause they're gonna last so long, like you definitely will replace your roof at some point during the system, but it's like, hey, if you can do that like 10 years from now instead of like having to pay a lot or do a different program with us, uh, right when you get it, then it's, you know. But that's why we do the survey, um, just so we're sure.
Speaker 1:
OK.
Speaker 2:
Almost done with the panel.
Speaker 1:
OK. Yeah, let's gods. Uh Uh. Yeah
Speaker 2:
Put
Speaker 1:
in some
Speaker 2:
of
Speaker 1:
these months.
Speaker 2:
Do you have any other projects that you're doing with the house currently?
Speaker 1:
We will soon be doing the backyard. Oh
Speaker 2:
cool. Are you, uh, like putting a new fence in or some grass or
Speaker 1:
Door, and yeah, it's going to be somewhat expensive, yeah. Yeah, OK. Why do you ask them, just for curiosity, just for your information, or does that affect?
Speaker 2:
I like curiosity, a lot of people like with these old houses, they have like a ton of projects going on and like sometimes it's like easier to coordinate like if you're
Speaker 1:
so that is a factor, just to be clear, this is something we'll be doing soon, and one of the things we will be doing is installing an electric car charger. Oh, cool, um, 2.0 volts, so that's a factor.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, no, that's awesome. Do you already have like a contractor for that and everything?
Speaker 1:
We had to sign the contract, but we are working for you.
Speaker 2:
OK, great. That's like another uh service that we provide, trying to help people get that. But if you already uh talking to someone that you like, then you just go with that, and then
Speaker 1:
when you say that's the service you provide, are you talking specifically about the charger or are you talking about other contracting services?
Speaker 2:
Other contracting services, we have a contractor that does the EV chargers, and the important thing on those, they're, they're pretty standard, um, but, uh, you can get almost like half your money back on it with the DC incentive and the federal incentive as well on it. So it's a, it's really cool.
Speaker 1:
So, is this something that they specialize in? Do you do only like electric ins installments?
Speaker 2:
That contractor, they do, I, I believe they do a lot of electric work. My other colleague has done like more of those through them. Usually when I help people out with these, I talk to him and I'm like, OK, yeah, we have another family that's looking to get an EV charger. Can we like get in touch with the contractor, get a quote out and like see where it would go and everything, and then they would, they would come out separately and just set that up for you whenever.
Speaker 1:
And is the quote free?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, yeah, you can get,
Speaker 1:
yeah. Do I get their information? They're separate information from you.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, what I would do if, if you'd like, uh, I could reach out and then they'll we'll get like a quote drawn up, and I'll, I'll probably just like take a picture of your backyard, like, if you have an idea of where you'd want to go or where it would be most easy for where you're parking the car, and then, yeah,
Speaker 1:
it would be nice to have the quote if it's free. Doesn't it. To coordinate it with everything else that's going up, that's not a standalone issue.
Speaker 2:
And that's one of the things that um it's like completely like separate from solar, like it doesn't affect the solar project, like, even if you, like we do like main panel upgrades for people all the time, and it's like, hey, you can do it before install, you can do it after install, really the only things that are gonna like affect the solar project. is if you're like replacing the HVAC or you're getting like roof work done or if there's just like really long projects like I had a a family that they were like an end unit like yours and like they were getting like the brick redone on the side and that was like taking a while we can't they're also working on the roof too so we kind of to do some more coordination. Um, but yeah, if you're getting an EV charger, you could do it next week, you could do it after the solar install, like, yeah, or end of end of the year would be good for that because then you get the tax credit on that next year.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, we also do not have a clear timeline for that. It also, you know, is contingent on other people's schedules too, so we're trying to get it moving.
Speaker 2:
OK, no worries. Well, if it would, uh, help to get like another quote on that, I'd be happy to.
Speaker 1:
I'm not against that, yeah, sure. OK.
Speaker 2:
All right. And I'm just simulating the design and I'll be able to show you what it's doing in just a moment.
Speaker 1:
To OK. All right This is about triple over here so this is good to see. I'm gonna follow you over there. I'll stay.
Speaker 2:
This is about what we can fit on the roof, and this is 21 channels. And it's gonna produce about 10,000 kilowatt hours for the year. You're using, just from the usage from the summer, it's about 4000, so we don't have your, your yearly on it, so I can't give you like a, hey, it's gonna cover 80% of your bill, or it's gonna cover 120% of your bill. But the good thing is the, the system, it just produces a constant amount of energy, like no matter what you're using, the system's just gonna produce 10,000 kitt hours. So, For example, for like the Uh, free solar project, it's like the 10,000 kilowatt hours it makes, it would save someone like $1600 of power throughout the year, and it's like, if you use less than that, then they pay you back the difference. At the end of the year. If you use more than that, then whatever you draw from PEPCO beyond the 10,000 kilowatt hours, it's just build up PEPCO's rate, but you just get your 1st 10,000 kilowatt hours for free, and then that's always true, it'll never go up, it's just always free. And then you get that with either program, so like you'd be saving $1600 or so dollars on power each year, uh, the program you did. But with the free one, you don't get the incentives, they use incentives to pay for it, and then that's that's it, you just get the savings or, you know, the extra check from Pepco if you your system overproduces, but if you buy it, then not only do you get the savings, but you'll get paid for all the clean power that the system makes. So, The value of that power. You would get 10 in your first year. They would pay you about 400 for all the power that the system makes.
Speaker 1:
Is this for only first year?
Speaker 2:
It would be for the 1st 3 years, and then it would go down and taper off after that. And there is like a value for the amount of power that you're being paid for and it's just supply and demand. The as more clean power gets on the grid, there's less, yeah, and they're fine, the Petcos, it's all off the Petco's fines like they're fined for 1000 kilowatt hours of dirty energy is like 480 bucks. So the amount of money that they're willing to pay is just. It's gonna be somewhere less than that. So it's like, it's like a little over $400 it's like $410 and for 10,000 kilowatt hours of energy, it'd be about $4000. It's fixed for the 1st 3 years, so you get like $4000 400 dollars, $4000 and all the savings as well, and then it'll start going down a little bit after that, but the return on investment is, it's usually like 4 or 5 years. So after that, it's just all. Profit even if it's like, you know, when it goes down to $3000 200 dollars, you know, 25 years from now it probably won't be too
Speaker 1:
much. So this is guaranteed more or less this um 4000 figure for for the 1st 3 years you said, and after that it kind of tapers now. Why do you say 4000? It's like if you own your panels, you generate more, yeah, so it's uh like in addition to the first yeah
Speaker 2:
yeah. And that's the, that's the cool thing too with the why the local incentives are, are so strong. It's guar so that number is guaranteed. So like, let's say something crazy happened and like, I don't know, the incentives just like went away, they'd still be obligated to pay you that amount.
Speaker 1:
Because we signed with them on time, and is there like deadline. I think this question came up a little bit, but I was unsure what the deadline would be you said putting an application, but if you were to put an application now but not be able to install it like until a year later, um, would it, would it be possible to kind of put the application in but not uh pull the trigger immediately?
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, there, there's like ways, uh, there's ways to see that, yes,
Speaker 1:
yes.
Speaker 2:
With the free program, when, when you submit your application, it, that's like the lock-in point to where if you submitted your application like this week and then next week they like change everything, you're good to go. With the purchase option though, when you submit your application and then a couple months from now you get installed after the system's installed, they will then set up your account or they'll be direct depositing you. The money for the power and then the that's when that would lock in is post install and then the tax credit would be like locked in whenever you do your taxes for the year that it's eligible for. So it wouldn't get install timeline, so like 3 or 4 months, so you wouldn't get it this year. So I'd say you'd get installed like January, February, uh, if, if you like did it sooner and then. Next year, like a year and a couple months from now, is when you get the tax credit back, but it's like anytime in that like a year and a half if the tax credit goes away, then you're kind of out of luck. But the good thing is, and like that's why I said there's why they're still investing in it. Even if the 30% goes away, you're still getting that money after the, uh, as long as nothing changes after the install and that's nothing's gonna change
Speaker 1:
with the local one that's as long as you're not leasing, you're just owning your panels, OK, so. What I'm wondering now is how much is it going to cost us before you answer that you quoted a figure of $1600 a year and how much we're gonna save on energy and we'll essentially get that cash back if we do the free install. Um, or regardless if we do the free install, uh, what is, I understand that you're citing the 10,000 kilowatt figure annually, where is the $1600 number coming from or basing that on current energy rates?
Speaker 2:
Yes, yeah. If I just think those
Speaker 1:
are horribly variable.
Speaker 2:
OK. The, the variability, it goes up, so it, uh, electric rates over the past like, you know, 50, 70 years, it doubles about every 15 years, and right now, there, it's about 16 cents a kilowatt. So for the savings, I just show people what it would be at today's rate, but rates, they never go down, they only go up. So I'm showing you as if like, Yeah, the 1600, that's what it would be like, let's say this year, but when rates go up to like 17 cents and 18 cents, and like, you know, up to 30 cents, you'll be, you'll be saving more at that point, but it wouldn't be a situation where that number goes down. And we're talking
Speaker 1:
annualized numbers, so you're figuring in whatever variation there would be within the year. Yep.
Speaker 2:
Like when they, they raised it 8%, uh, the electric rate, um, about the time that you guys moved in. So while since about like June, uh, that's where when I do these for people, I usually, it's about 16 cents electric rate, but for that it was like closer to 15 cents, so. Earlier this year, I would have done like 15 cents times 10,000 kilowatt hours, but now that power costs more and it's more valuable and I even have like a, I have a spreadsheet that's more complicated, but I usually just assume like, hey, it'll go up like 1 cent, like every other year. It's usually more than that, but I like to be pretty conservative on these for people, so.
Speaker 1:
Yeah.
Speaker 2:
And the uh total cost on this system size 8.51 kilowatts is about $27,000. So if you just like, let's say you just like road check for it, it'd be about $27,000 and then that would be the number that the tax credit would be based on. So, Tax credit of about 8300, and you can do whatever you want with that money, like, you can, you know, take it and, you know, buy a hot tub or go on vacation or Uh, a lot of people they'll finance their system because not everyone has the money line around and they'll just apply it to the financing that they get and it'll like lower your payments. And that's the one that, um, yeah, you would just submit for your taxes, and I don't know net cost closer like 19,000.
Speaker 1:
You keep talking about panel reinstalls, um, so I'm thinking about the lifetime of the system, um, solar panel efficiency increases, um, what would be involved in upgrading the panels at some point.
Speaker 2:
Wouldn't need to. The efficiency on panels, it's, you know, like low to mid 20% efficiencies. The way the efficiency is calculated, uh, you're never gonna get like, like 100% because the sunlight has to go. The only way you get 100% is like if you're in space and there's like, there's like some cool things that they've tested where they can like beam it to space. Um, panels will, they will get, uh, you know, more efficient, but we're talking about like a couple percent and it's like, You know, if you put 270 into a system, and then, you know, even if they come out with something that's like 5% better or 10% better, it's not gonna really benefit you to spend another 300 and, you know, get rid of the system to get a new one. There really won't be a point where that'll, um, you know, make a lot of sense. And Um, unless you just always wanna have like the, just the best, uh, technology on your roof. But, uh, what we install on your roof, it's, uh, we don't really, we don't really pick the equipment. The mandate for all the power that has to be generated by solar gear, it has to be generated by tier one equipment. There's all these ratings on solar equipment and efficiencies and things like that. Tier one equipment is gonna be the about the highest efficiency that you can get. There's like Like other panels I could show you that like, hey, maybe they produce like 5 kilowatt hours more per year or, or uh it would be, or it's like a 420 watt panel instead of like a 405 watt panel, you get a little more out of it or there's like ones that are like You know, they're like 1% better on the degradation over 30 years or like 1% worse. But any tier one equipment, that's like the, uh, that's the standard and it has to be that equipment. So we are putting the best available equipment on the house, and then, yeah, maybe they come out with something a couple% better years from now, but it's not gonna benefit you to. You know, spend 3000 now and then like $300 in like 5 or 10 years again when you have something that works really well.
Speaker 1:
So whose system is this that we got the quote on? Is it solar solutions?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, that would be, that would be through solar solutions, yes.
Speaker 1:
What other companies are you working with?
Speaker 2:
Uh, we work with ROI Construction is one that we do a lot through, and then, uh, we used to use advanced more, uh, but not as much anymore, uh, so we should. The solar solution, we use them more because they have a lot more install crews. They've been around for 17 years and they've done the most installs. So what we're looking for in an installer is volume, cause we do a lot of these projects, reliability, and just like, hey, we don't wanna You know, spend all of our time doing like project management when, you know,
Speaker 1:
seeing projects through it.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I will say like uh like ROI, they're amazing. We actually helped uh build out a lot of their solar division. They've been a roofing company. for like 50 years, they, their panels are like that's when they're, they're like slightly better, you get like a little bit more out of them, but nothing to make, you know, a huge difference, but they're like, cause they're newer, they're like at their max. Like I don't know if you get installed until like You know, maybe the, the summer, they're just like really backed up right now and I can't really put any more projects through them. So because solar solution has like way more volume, they've done a lot more reliable, then that's why most of my projects go through them. I think ROI is gonna be a better installer maybe a year from now, uh, once they get their capabilities up, but like, my goal is to give people the best experience. It's not something that you guys wanna be spending hours of your time on and Um, yeah, things change around a lot. Like I was putting a lot of my projects through ROI earlier this year, cause they're like a little better. I get like the a little bit more insight into the projects, but like, I can't really put any in right now cause they're, they're backed up and the whole goal is to get these in so before anything potentially changes and Things, uh, things change around a lot and that's why we work with so many installers.
Speaker 1:
Um, I have a question, and this is something that I purely found out when I was reading on the subject. It's like there's apparently something called price matching. Um, do you negotiate those things for your clients or, OK, so if somebody gives us a, you know, a better quote than 27 and they're like, let's say. It's gonna say it was like 2000. So would, would it be possible to?
Speaker 2:
We, yeah, we price match anything and that's where like we too, we have like because we're bringing so many jobs to these installers, it's kind of like a group discount we already have negotiated rates with them. You can definitely find like a a cheaper quote like for sure. Um, and that's kind of why we really that the installers that we're working with, like, you could probably find someone that'll, you know, do the system for like 220. But the thing to avoid in in DC, uh, because of the free program, that's like about 90 95% of people, that's what they do instead of buying it. A lot of companies from out of state will come here and just like start up an office and then not know how to do anything. They don't know how to work with PEPCO. Like I was just working with a family and they were over in Northwest and they had signed up with this company that was like from Texas and they had done like 6 installs and it was. Like, you know, seems like a really good deal. Yeah, they, their project, it was like stuck for months and like with PEPCO because they didn't know what they didn't have the right information to submit. They submitted it wrong. They didn't get everything they needed on the survey is what it looked like. And they, they should have already been installed by that other company. So like, while it was like, you know, it seemed like a really good deal, the other company didn't know what they were doing and like, you know, a lot of people, they, they come here, they try to make a quick buck, and then like, you know, when things happen like if there's a recession or if there's like the economy stuff, like those ones are the first to go and you don't want your solar company going out of business, so. That's why we, um, again, like solar solution is so good cause they've been around for 17 years, you know, they'll be able, if any, they're gonna be able to survive pretty much anything, but even if they, like, let's say you get installed solar solution and they go out of business. then we would just switch it as your representative to be maintained by one of our other installers, and then go from there. And then like, hey, if, if we go out of business for some reason, you know, you still have all your warranties and everything, maintain with the installer. If any, if anyone goes out of business, uh, we have a us and the installer, we have a legal obligation to transfer all your warranties, you can maintain them or better, and that's uh OK, so that's like the long bit with like uh what company you're gonna go with, but yeah, if you find a if you have a different quote that's like, you know, same equipment and it's cheaper, we will absolutely price match it, yeah.
Speaker 1:
So, can you give us some equipment information like this system, what um what its capabilities are so we can make some comparisons and if need be, when we make the decision, get some quotes on that too. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
uh, like, what, uh, like their dimensions or like how they're attached to the roof or
Speaker 1:
Well, I'm not an expert, so I'm not very good at math too. What I'm trying to say that. Some information that will allow me to make comparisons. What would I need in order to make comparisons with other quotes, and so that's the information that I need.
Speaker 2:
Um, yeah, I could send you like. A like a product sheet.
Speaker 1:
That would be great, you know, if you could send us information about this particular quote too, like what it's based on and.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, I'll put, I'll put everything in an email for you.
Speaker 1:
That sounds great.
Speaker 2:
But
Speaker 1:
let me see.
Speaker 2:
For
Speaker 1:
example. This is.
Speaker 2:
These are the panels that I put on your roof and then this is just the product sheet and it has like all the scientific stuff on it and everything. And then like this would be a different one.
Speaker 1:
And
Speaker 2:
they're about the same dimensions like these panels are the 420 watt ones. They are like, yeah, they have 15 more watts per panel, um. It's like, hey, it's like, you know, 0.4% degradation for each year for 30 years, uh, 1% on the first year. It's about the same curve on this one. Um, and then I mean your panel options is like. Kind of like And there's like.
Speaker 1:
Uh
Speaker 2:
We do all these and then there's like there's like 20 more.
Speaker 1:
I what's called.
Speaker 2:
Um, I just, I, I'll definitely send you that product sheet when, uh, before I leave with the email. I would say like that's one of those things where you know you could spend like a year researching like 100 different kind of PMIs um they're all about the same, um, yeah,
Speaker 1:
OK. I'm, I'm just asking because you mentioned tier one systems and other systems probably quality matters here and longevity matters. That's why I'm trying to get more specific information so that we can compare it with other, you know, companies that would give us a comparable quote for this, this kind of system. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2:
And those are two like, uh, yeah, if you do it, uh. Uh, any other quotes or or whatnot, then like I'd be happy to, uh, like check what equipment they have and like I have the product sheets for my stuff so I can just like, oh hey, here's the one for on that quote they're using like the Atos panels like you know go from there. And yeah, that's pretty much it. Uh, pretty much everyone uses the same uh racking system, like they're gonna get. Attached to the side walls, kind of like uh this. So we don't penetrate the actual roof itself like the membrane. Uh, they just do it on the sidewalls and then later across. Uh, there's another option where you can do a direct mounting or it does go directly on that, but
Speaker 1:
yeah. Is there any maintenance involved?
Speaker 2:
No, there's no maintenance. There are in that realm of things though, with like a lot of people ask about like repairs and things like that. If anything goes wrong in the summer, there's two things that could go wrong. Number one is like an act of God, like a, like a tree falls on it or there's like a hurricane or something like that and then busts the system. That's all covered by the installer. And then the second thing that could happen is like, let's say, you know, you have like a defective panel for some reason or just some reason the system isn't working how it should be. Then we get a notification cause the, uh, they put a box in your house, and that keeps track of everything, and you can log into an app on your phone and see everything the system's doing, and they have access to that too. So usually, like, let's say, let's say your inverter goes. Out at like year 6, they would get a notification, you get a notification, and we'd be calling you up and saying, hey, can we come out and, you know, replace your inverter? Uh, we say it's broken, and uh as long as like you won't be responsible for any of that, they, they cover all that for you. Uh, the only difference with um The, with the purchase option if uh an act of God happens, it's uh it's already actually covered by your homeowner's insurance, and then if for some reason the homeowner's insurance didn't want to work with it, then uh you have us as a backup and fix it for you. But uh with the free one, they just, uh, you don't have to touch your home insurance at all.
Speaker 1:
But yeah. One question that I had, which I still do not have a lot of clarity is about um this kind of 1600 savings on the bills. Um, so what would I pay on a monthly basis in addition to this discount, like, you know, depending on our consumption right now?
Speaker 2:
You mean for like if you bought the system
Speaker 1:
or if you did if you bought the system,
Speaker 2:
yeah, if you do uh financing, that's that's kind of up to you because you can finance it anywhere from like 5 years to 20 years. So, if you want to, usually if you're looking at financing, there's like two ways to do it. You could either, uh, a lot of people, they will do the 5 year option, and it's about break even, what you're saving on the power, and then what you're getting paid from the incentives will be about equal to what your payment for the financing would be. And you really wouldn't have any cash flow or anything from it, but in 5 years, or if you're looking to just pay it off as soon as possible, then you're getting to that point where you're making, you know, 3 or $40 each year, uh, pure profit, and then, you know, that gets to. It's like, hey, break even for a couple of years and then more profit sooner, or the other strategy is like, hey, spread it out as long as possible. If you do the 20 year, the payments obviously gonna be a lot lower and then you maximize your cash flow in the beginning, but then you'd be paying that payment a lot longer. Most of the people I work with, they do the, they just do like the 5 year option or like a 7 year, but there's like, you know, there's like 6 different options you can do. It's just all about what you want to do with it. Um, yeah, that's usually how those work. Uh, interest rates suck right now. Um, so, uh, there's two ways to do the, the financing too, um, like, hey, I could, I could get you a really good interest rate if you want, like if, you know, like a 4 or 5% interest rate. Problem with those, uh, loans is that there's gonna be a lot of fees on it, and it's like instead of financing $27,000 it's like you're gonna be financing like what, 50%. And you know, over the lifetime of the financing, it's like you're gonna be paying half of it in in fees, which I don't think benefits anyone. So we do one that's uh they, it's zero fees and then it's a higher interest rate like it's like 10% interest rate, but there's no fees on it and it benefits our clients the most so um yeah, I see. But uh, yeah, the payment would be whatever you want, um. It's anywhere from uh break even to you'd be making cash flow um right at the start,
Speaker 1:
yeah. If we do the lease option, um. What happens to ownership once the value of the system is covered by Uh, the Whatever the technical term is, the, the penalty from Pep.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, like once they hit their their target,
Speaker 1:
they, they continue to own it, I assume. Yes, and What would be our obligation to them and any subsequent owner of this home. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
they pretty much just want to use their roof space for 20 years, and that's kind of how it works. They want to make the incentive for the next 20 years, cause even though the target's 8 years from now, they're paying out on these incentives for like, they're gonna be doing it for 20 or 25 years. So once they've hit that or like, you know, once they've paid the sum, they're just gonna own it for the 20 years. However, you can buy it yourself if you want, like after year 6, they'll let you buy it if you want, and they would have someone come out, they would assess the Like third parties, so it's fair and then they'll get a fair market value for what your system's worth at that time, and then you could purchase it and then whatever incentives are being paid, you know, you can start collecting on them. So you could do like the free program for a couple years and then go ahead and buy it at that point.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, yeah, but I read that it's not very advantageous to buy it because you're paying double for it when you're trying to buy it back from the original owner, your people you're easing from is what I heard.
Speaker 2:
When you go to buy it from leasing it,
Speaker 1:
yeah,
Speaker 2:
yeah, and also like the incentives have never been higher, so like it's like if you buy it 6 years from now, like you're like starting when it's like, you know, instead of $40 a year you'd be it'd be like, you know, 2 or 30 maybe and that's where now is the best time to buy. It's like, yeah, you can buy it in 6 years, but like if you're thinking about doing it, then it's like.
Speaker 1:
But why don't you do
Speaker 2:
it sooner and make more money off of it. Yeah. But yeah,
Speaker 1:
we, we just a matter of whether or not we can we can afford it now, in the terms we want to get it, um,
Speaker 2:
and that's why like, yeah, 95% of the people do the free one like the purchase option is great and like, yeah, it can be pretty lucrative like $40 a year and then like also saving 6 150 $1600 like that puts you up like, you know, like over $5000. Year than what you're currently doing right now. But it's like, yeah, that's where it does become like, you know, a bigger project where it's like you gotta figure out like if that's gonna make sense for you financially and um now it's like if you take out financing for it, you're, it's like another loan to deal with. That's why most people do the free one because it's just way easier and you just get the savings you never have to touch it and If you wanna purchase it later, you that's still an option you can do, yeah.
Speaker 1:
Can I get you more water? No, no, it's, thanks. Yeah. Do you have any questions?
Speaker 2:
And did that answer your question well off on like what happens with like the roof and everything and like? OK, great, great. Thank you. Well yeah, let me um put some of this stuff together for you in an email. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
sure. I'll give you an email address. Do you want yours added or mine? Oh you put in. What do you think of uh Tesla's solar installers?
Speaker 2:
I wouldn't say I would know enough to have an opinion. They don't install in DC anymore. Strongest opinion I have is the uh Tesla roofs that they do like the shingles is really cool technology, but that's like 1000. Of course. I have. Yes, yeah. I have, uh, I've had more experience with them in other markets, um, like I used to work in New Mexico, that's actually where I met Martin, and they did a lot of installs out there, but they were kind of like Going like the, the fast and cheap route and like we had people they would get installed and then like you know they didn't do it right and they have a they're paying for a solar system for a year and uh no they aren't allowed to turn it on because it didn't get installed right. I'm sure they've done plenty of great uh installations and stuff thank you um but And you can, if you find another company that you love or like maybe you got a really good uh recommendation from a friend that did it, like I would say go with that or like if you I don't know like a family member or something like go with that cause like I, I haven't known you guys for too long um but definitely. Go with a local company that like knows DC and like does work here and like an out of state one
Speaker 1:
that's like sustainable youth based in DC
Speaker 2:
yeah, our office is, uh, it's like right around the corner.
Speaker 1:
OK yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. How long has it been operating in this region?
Speaker 2:
2019? OK.
Speaker 1:
Got the sense you were the founder.
Speaker 2:
No, no, no, um, a guy named Marcus Hoy is the founder. He actually used to work at Tesla, um, but no, I do, uh, a lot of our sales and consulting and uh some of the other projects we're working on. That's like my role, yeah.
Speaker 1:
Um, Excuse me for the invasiveness of this question, but what is your funding model? How are you getting? Not you directly, but how does the company get funded? Are you taking a bite of some payment? Made by one of us or do you have outside funding how is that working?
Speaker 2:
Yes's a great, great question. We primarily make money by the volume that we bring to installers because like when we put like 60-70 jobs through solar solution this month, it's a lot cheaper for them to pay us to bring those projects to them then yeah then to spend the advertising dollars they spend a lot on advertising. And that's how we make much more money.
Speaker 1:
Does that become a conflict of interest in terms of finding the best installer? Um. If you do the work yourself, get a better quote, they match. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
you could, uh, you could say so cause like, yeah, what if we were like. Hey, let's just go with the with the installer that is like paying us the most for the the volume that we that we bring them. Like, we could, we could try doing that. So, the way we work though, if you guys have a bad experience, then you're not gonna tell your neighbors about it, and you're you're probably gonna tell people that you had a bad experience with it, and that's gonna hurt the market. And we really care about getting you guys the best experience, like, we want you to, you know, be vocal to your neighbors about it and like other people, like, we want as many people to do this as possible. Uh, we care a lot about, you know, like our views and our our like BVB rating, uh, we wanna make sure this is a great experience and Yeah, maybe there's like, like, for example, like ROI, the one that we work more uh directly with since we helped build their solar division, we make a little bit more off those projects because we do more profit sharing with them because we help build their part of their solar solar uh division. But I'd rather put this through solar solution and have us make less because they're more reliable right now and they can handle the volume we're getting on.
Speaker 1:
So, yeah, yeah, money
Speaker 2:
is important like we gotta stay aloat too, but um we're optimizing it on who's gonna do the best work for you, um, not necessarily, you know, who's gonna make us the most funny.
Speaker 1:
OK, you
Speaker 2:
know.
Speaker 1:
OK. Who sustainable
