Speaker 1:
Hello, Never sin. My name is Martin. Good morning to you. OK. Hey, I'm calling with Sustainable You. We help out with the free solar program. I was just calling to see if you guys have taken advantage of that yet. OK, got you. Uh, my friend Paul asked me to give you guys a call. Did you have any questions or anything about the free solar program? OK. Did you get a chance to sit down with him and go over everything?
Speaker 2:
OK.
Speaker 1:
I understand. Yeah, we're just reaching out to everybody because I'm sure you've probably already seen what happened on the news with the new administration. He put a pause on all the funding, uh, for these like solar projects and like, you know, EV stuff. Um, free solar still exists. You can still go solar completely for free as long as your application is in while the program is alive and well. So we're just calling the people who know about it and want to do it, do it before anything might change in the future.
Speaker 2:
with my spare change. OK, I got your number. The numbers on the cell.
Speaker 1:
Mhm. Uh, does that sound like something you guys would want to do soon?
Speaker 2:
No, not right at this moment. OK.
Speaker 1:
Uh, maybe next week. Should I give you guys a call back?
Speaker 2:
OK.
Speaker 1:
No worries. We have my number here. If you have any questions about, uh, any of the programs, uh, you can feel free to reach out. Um, yeah, my name is Martin.
