Speaker 1:
Did it. Um, I think the reason why we opted not to is because we were gonna need to make like a like a $10,000 upfront kind of commitment and just wasn't a priority. There's lots of things to do. So it's always something that we're, you know, redoing or we need to take care of, you know, so that wasn't at the top of the list.
Speaker 2:
What what's the next project for you guys?
Speaker 1:
No, so we just did this, the kitchen and the dining room and this room this well it ended this year. We started last year, it ended this year. It's a long project, um, and so after doing that, you're kind of like. You know, no more. There's still, there's still it's like you don't want to.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, yeah. Well you have some time to take a breath. Oh man. Well, fortunate thing about solar is like, uh, you know, I mean you can do it yourself and get up and start whacking a hammer on your roof, but no, that's why companies like I see this like our whole mission is just to make this as easy and rewarding for you as possible. Um, and especially because you, you looked at it a couple of years ago, probably what Martin told you
Speaker 1:
is more than 5.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, definitely more than $500 or 5
Speaker 1:
years. Oh yeah,
Speaker 2:
um, it's probably pretty expensive and that's why most people didn't do it. So, uh, now we have the free program in DC and that's like what 90% of my clients do, or maybe like 95% cause like. You know, no one wants to spend, you know, $30,000 on a solar system that's, you know, you're gonna have to wait like 5 or 6 years to get payback on, and no one wants to take out like a loan at, you know, 10% interest. So free is way better. Um, did Martin kind of explain like how that is like set up and how it works for folks?
Speaker 1:
Um, so no, I don't think we had an opportunity to talk through any of that.
Speaker 2:
No worries, um, I don't know if you're familiar with the, uh, 2018 Clean Energy Act. Um, but it may need 100% clean energy for DC, uh, by 2032, and it was like eight years, and not only that, but it all has to be made inside DC. So they can't ship it in from, you know, a solar field in New Jersey. It has to be made here, and PEPCO would love to, you know, go build massive solar fields and just do it that way. That's like way cheaper, but
Speaker 1:
they can't do this.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah,
Speaker 1:
so
Speaker 2:
pretty.
Speaker 1:
get it by like buying credits from somewhere else. I mean some of them they'll have to do through credits, right? Well yeah,
Speaker 2:
they'll, um, so they can't buy credits from like Maryland or Virginia. They have to be bought here and that's why the market's like crazy because your people's roofs is like the only place you can put it and because they can only like get those credits from DC, it's like you're just they just became prime real estate and they're paying top dollar for it, so. Uh, the free program is pretty easy. Uh, those local incentives that will fund the entire project, so it'll be completely free install. You know, there's no payment. We'll never collect payment information from you. I mean, as long as you don't like, uh, go up on your roof and like take a flamethrower to it or something, but, um, but, uh, yeah, you want to pay anything for it, it's a fixed 0% rate, it never changes, never goes up, and it's 30 years of free power.
Speaker 1:
OK, yeah. So, so I guess, so help me understand, so it gets installed for free. Who owns the solar panel? The, the solar owns the solar panel. So basically, OK, so the installer owns the solar panel and the energy from the solar panel goes into the house. Is it, is it gonna be, I don't know how many kilowatts we use, but If it's so we we'll still be connected to Pepco obviously, right? So let's just say it happen on extreme case, all of the energy that we get from the solar panel in a day. Is a little bit more than what we're actually consuming. What happened to the extra? Is it being stuck in the battery or is it? Oh
Speaker 2:
yeah, that's the cool part. So even though they own the system, you own all the power and you have right solar power, so your phone gets used at first, and then when there is access, that gets sent to the grid and they keep track of that so. Like, come back to us as a credit? Yes, yes. So like you'll send more during the day than you use and then you'll still use PEPCO at night, but you won't be paying for that because like your mirrors can run backwards a bit. And how it works is at the end of the year, if you sent them more power than you've used in that year, they will send you a check for the difference.
Speaker 1:
OK, so we do technically. We get the the we're selling our credits annually and for how many years do we get to do that? Is there a fix like, oh, you only get to do that for the 1st 5 years, then after that, you know, it's it's the full 30 years and at the end of the 30 years we still own, I mean they still own the, the system we'll, I guess we'll have to. There's a couple options at
Speaker 2:
the end.
Speaker 1:
The panel will be obsolete by that point,
Speaker 2:
right? So no, um, the there's a warranty on the production at 30, the panels will be about 7 and 90% output as they are in year one. OK, so they might be viable up there longer than I. But they'll, they'll probably have like utility scale renewables or like some crazy infinite energy thing, but I don't know, um, but this will at least carry you to then and then if there isn't something like that, you know, there's still gonna be 90%
Speaker 1:
output. So basically the idea is that Uh, I'm just, I'm trying to get to the crux of the, like, where's the catch here? Basically it's that they need to find space to put these solar panels and so they're, they're basically letting people, letting people use the power that they generate because it gives them a place to put solar panels.
Speaker 2:
They don't help and that's like if they don't help pay for people's systems, there's an opposite fine that they have to pay. And last year they paid $1.7 million in compliance fees because they produced more yeah yeah.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, OK, but yeah, you're saying it gets them out of the fees because I'm sure those will will escalate.
Speaker 2:
Whoa, that's the thing. They go, they go down over time.
Speaker 1:
OK, the fees go down over time
Speaker 2:
as they get more,
Speaker 1:
right, but if they don't get more solar. I would say so,
Speaker 2:
yeah, they'd probably restructure it, um, because right now it's like with the percent as the percentage goes up as the, as more people get solar, you know, they're gonna be rewarded for helping pay for people's systems by their fines going down. But I guess if that doesn't happen, then they're probably gonna keep paying those fines and then they might even restructure it. And like who knows, but the, the catch is not everyone gets to do it, cause like some roos don't get enough sunlight, and others like you'll get hit with something called field verification, which is like uh they may need to upgrade parts of the grids or like the local transformer to be able to handle the power you're sending back and I have projects sometimes like Um, it's not extremely common, but it's like, you know, we get past the PEPCO approval and they're like, hey, you can go solar, but you gotta pay like 20 grand to upgrade uh this part of the grid. Do you still wanna, uh, pay 200 to get free solar. And no, so we would just cancel the project, um, and that does happen, so not everyone gets to do it, but for, uh, most people, it ends up working out and yeah.
Speaker 1:
And being that a number of our soldiers on either side of us have already gone, a number of our our neighbors on either side of us have already gone solar, we can probably infer that our, our portion of the grid is one equipped to handle it, um. And I think we've already had somebody tell us that we get enough sunlight for it.
Speaker 2:
You definitely get enough sunlight. I'll tell you that right now, yeah, um, that one can can be kind of tricky with like, uh, cause I have one right now where it's like there's 3 houses like boom boom boom right next to each other, and one of them got hit with the field verification and then they removed it and they're like, OK, no, actually it's fine, like you're good. Um, and then the other one got hit with nothing and then we just installed her like a week ago and then the other one was like, oh you have to pay 100 to go solar. Do you wanna go solar, and it's like we had, we had to cancel his project and then but they're all right next to each other so I don't like it's very hard. To tell like it's like maybe that one was like right on the line and like the one person that got installed like but we sent in his application before hers so I don't, it's like very hard to tell. Pepco is a for-profit company and they are not easy to work with sometimes. So, um, there is that, but I would just say it's it's uncommon, and if we do run into that, we'll let you know.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, OK, so. So the, the, the company that owns the do the store owns and so on, who's, who is the, I mean who owns the company? Is it this government? How how does that work? Like what, what is your, so that's, I guess, sorry, two part question. So what is the incentive for them? I mean, at the end of the day, what is the valid proposition for them? Somebody is gonna be making money, otherwise, I mean, I mean unless they're a nonprofit.
Speaker 2:
So, um, or first off I wanna say no one from the government, um, or from the city or anyone is ever gonna come to your house and talk to you about solar. No, they don't install solar. There's no one from the government that does any form of anything even remotely close to that. They just pay for it. So if someone's like telling you like, hey, we're like from the government, we're gonna put free solar in your house. I, I would like start asking questions. Uh, they pay for everything though, and that's the incentive for the insullers to do this. They're happy to put this on people's houses for free because that makes it a million times easier for people to do it, and then they're playing the long game, they're collecting that, uh, those payments from PEPCO, that's paying for the clean power so they don't have to pay their fines. So they, they'll make all their money back in like 5 or 6 years and then they'll still profit after that.
Speaker 1:
The so you mean, yeah, yeah,
Speaker 2:
and it's like you can do that too. Like you can buy it yourself, but like who wants to pay $3000 for the solar system we're like
Speaker 1:
I take on costs, right? If you have $3000 that you're like, oh, I'm looking to invest and I wanna don't, you know, mind getting my returns later, then yeah, fine. And so, so they own it, who does the main, I mean, I don't know if it requires any maintenance, who does the maintenance, and then if we need to do repair to the roof or the air conditioner, which is also upstairs, I mean up on the roof, um, who, what do we mean? who does all of that?
Speaker 2:
The installer handles all of that, and there you're right, there's no. maintenance, there's no like services that we'll need. There's no moving parts. It's pretty much just like, uh, it's kind of like a roof. You put it up there and like you kind of forget about it for 15 years. But like, you know, a roof can get a leak or something, you know, I don't promise anyone that like in 30 years, like nothing's gonna go wrong. So there's like two things that can happen, like let's say there's a hailstorm, a tree falls on it, like an act of God. They're responsible for all that. And then the second thing is if there's like a defective panel or like uh most common thing is like let's say the inverter goes out at like year 6 and that's just the thing that converts the power from DCAC so that we can use it. If it goes out, we'll get a notification. You'll get a notification. Because you have access to the monitoring on your phone as well and then we'll be calling you up and saying, hey, like we noticed your inverter went out like can we come out next Friday and you know, replace it for you? And then as long as like you didn't like purposely cause any damage to your system, they're covering any cost for all those things for the life of the system.
Speaker 1:
OK, so they covered the system from the from the roof or do we because somewhere else it's gonna be connected to our Whatever, uh, the circuit board downstairs. So from there all the cable all the way down to the 2 we become we be covered, OK,
Speaker 2:
and there's like um. They'll run a conduit down to the meter, and then the only uh portion on the inside of the home is they'll just connect something from the meter on the outside to your breaker box on the inside. So they'll just like make a hole in like the brick or whatever, and then they'll run it through and they'll patch it all up, and then that's all the, that's the extent of the inside work. Everything else is up on the roof.
Speaker 1:
OK. Um, and let's say like I don't remember how old our roof is, but it's maybe 10 years old, right? So let's say in another 10 years I need to replace that roof, and that means I need the solar taken down so that I can have somebody come and do that, um, and stored the costs for the takedown and storage and all of that. The installer bears that cost.
Speaker 2:
Uh, so, no, uh, it is, uh, it, uh, and that was like the second part of your question which I wanted to answer. So because the panels are gonna last so long, you, you will replace your roof at some point. Like you're not gonna, even if you're like covering the, the whole roof of panels, like it's like you're gonna replace it at some point in the next 30 years. So what happens is we'll come out, we'll do the removal, and we'll store them if we need to, we'll do the roof and then we'll reinstall the system. And you're right, it's not free to uh do that work to take them off and put them back on. However, uh, what we do to make it a really easy process for homeowners is we have roofing partners. So when you have the same company that's. replacing your roof and then also doing the removal reinstall, you get a really good deal on the roof. And if anything, like, hey, it might be like 10% more or so than like, you know, doing a roof, uh, like regular if you didn't have solar. But then it's like, hey, you're also saving like $1500 a year for the next 30 years or whatever it will be for um your electric usage. OK. OK. But in general, I would, I would just say that a new roof. It's just like a little bit extra coordination. We'll uh take care of all that for you. You don't have to coordinate with like a solar company and a roofing company. We'll do it all for you. Um, and it shouldn't be too much more expensive than getting a regular roof done anyway.
Speaker 1:
Yeah. OK.
Speaker 2:
Um, and I would like to show you what this would do with your electric bill. Do you have like, uh, do you get like a paper bill or you pull it up online or
Speaker 1:
do I have? Yeah, OK.
Speaker 2:
I'll plug the usage from it into the design here and I'll just see what it's gonna pull up.
Speaker 1:
OK, so I have um. One that was this one I think it's my October 1 yeah OK that's fine. Cause
Speaker 2:
they put your uh.
Speaker 1:
My usage there.
Speaker 2:
And really it looks like it's getting up there in like August and September.
Speaker 1:
Yes, so one of the things that we did was we installed um split unit AC and so in this room and then in the office that's above that room, um, so that way those rooms are more comfortable because they're not on the main heating and air conditioning system. OK, yeah, so there's there heat and AC, so we also anticipate that going up in the winter, yeah, because we didn't have heater AC in those, in those rooms previously. Well, maybe we did a long time ago we had. What units Got you Those window units get old fast. I mean like dealing with them. Like my dad, he doesn't have any like AC throughout the house, so like come summer time, time to install 8 of those across the whole house at winter time, time to take all that with the phone, like all the seals and everything. It's like a whole process. He so hated that. And then we had when we first moved into this house, so then it's like, oh, does this window go up anymore? Yeah, and if you don't take them down, you have to go buy some plastic thing to cover the back so that otherwise during the winter the hair just the draft just go. Mm, no, I don't. Oh man, I keep looking at you guys' kitchen over here. Uh, the backsplash, uh, is that like tile and grout or is it like the stuff like stick on? It's tile. Oh my goodness. Oh, I did, I redid, uh, yeah, during the summer I like work construction and, uh, I redid a, um, a kitchen for the first time and I was like doing like a tile and grout like a backsplash, and um I messed up the grout and I was like I need to add more started putting it on there and started hardening it and like. I had to scrape and scrub for about for hours and hours and like days for because I, it was the worst thing ever yeah eventually I just got like an orbital sander like I I was using my hand. I was like let's go to orbital sanders. It was grace gra graze over the whole thing. It was terrible, but that looks really, really good.
Speaker 2:
Thank you. Oh thanks. OK. So this is about uh what you can do on your roof. And you have some obstructions like, uh, or when you play, are these all HVAC units?
Speaker 1:
I'm trying to figure out where. Oh yes, so I'm trying to figure out, so this is my roof, and this is the front 5511.
Speaker 2:
Yes, this is the right.
Speaker 1:
OK, so this is this is the front of the house. OK, so what are these?
Speaker 2:
Those are the panels.
Speaker 1:
Oh that's where the panels. Oh, you just, that's the demo if you put a pile, OK. So this and this, these are skylights for the bathrooms, you know, they used to have like those little dog houses over there. Um, the dog houses aren't there anymore, but we have skylights there. It does look like that on the on top of the roof, yes, because the bathrooms are like this. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, this is probably the air conditioner that unit, right? This is the hatch that you can take from inside of the house. I have no idea what that is. I didn't either. And I have no idea what that is. Oh, OK. Yeah, it was like, so this part of the house would have been an addition. This back portion here, which is this right here yeah and I don't know why it has that marked like that.
Speaker 2:
I'm wondering if like the original roof was like
Speaker 1:
oh so this this part of the house right here ups and downs not new, it's an addition. It's not part of the original 50 years ago or whatever. So actually, for example here this part of the roof is like um when they put on our roof, the roof that was on here when we moved in. There were two roofs, like they just laid like there was like a tin roof over this part and they just laid the black top part like over it. So when they were ready to redo it, like now we have, I forget what it's that the white like poly something like a, you know, um. I don't even know what what it's called a membrane, like a membrane. When they did that, I think they actually didn't take up that initial part, but I don't know why that would mean you can't. So this is the hatch, right?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, that's hatch right there, OK. And um because that's roof, I thought it was like, I don't know it's just like a big white box but that looks that look that makes sense now, yeah, you could fit more panels.
Speaker 1:
So even if you have it this way, so if the air conditioning unit is there, what is gonna be the is there gonna be access between the panels in the AC?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, like. These panels right here, um, they'd probably be done, uh, like with like solar stack or something similar like that. It's like a direct amount instead of like on
Speaker 1:
um. What's the word I can't think of the answer. OK, so this isn't flat. It's a sloped roof. You, you, you, I'm sure you do this all the time, right? It's the part of the roof that sort of goes up.
Speaker 2:
Like
Speaker 1:
there's a like there's a slope,
Speaker 2:
OK. Is it more? Do you think it's more aggressive than like, I thought that line was like where it started going up. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
that's about right, because there's actually, and you can see from that image right there, there's like um like some tubing that's going into the side there. That's where the inner portion of the um AC unit at the HVAC is, and it goes through the part that's like climbing.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, you'll be good though. Yeah, we usually just put these like a little bit before it. um, this like this would get approved, uh, you know, for the panels like they can walk around, like, like you can walk on top of them. Like anyone like that needs to service anything can do that. Uh, they'd probably just like if you need a skylight replaced, they can just like walk around and, you know, use the neighbor's roof as a staging area and same thing on this side. And
Speaker 1:
um I don't foresee that being something that would need to happen. OK,
Speaker 2:
yeah, if there would be anything, uh they do have to comply with like fire code and things like that. So like they're not gonna put panels anywhere where it'll leave stuff inoperable if it needs replaced, um, and also in accordance with fire code yeah. And then if there's, if there are any design changes, um, you know, when we, before we go to see this PEPCO, I'll be the first to let you know. I like to try to get it as close as possible as what it'll be, um, but sometimes we can like add a panel or take one off, um, but if anything significant, then I'll be like, I'll be the first to let you know. And let mere string this with the additional panels like. Oh wait, it's already done. And stimulate that. OK. So you're using. OK, 8,0017 yeah. Coatt hours times electric rate. So you're currently spending about $1300 a year in the power. This system would be $11,700. So you'll be in the situation where you're not only getting, you won't only save the $1300 on your bill, but you'll get an extra check at the end of the year for all the extra power you sent. And the amount of that would be.
Speaker 1:
It's interesting, because before they had always said, oh, you won't create enough power to cover everything that you're using. Really?
Speaker 2:
Yeah. Panels have changed a lot, um, and like inverter technology in the last, like they might have shown you like a 290 watt panel, and these are like these are like 4 or 5 watt panels, so, yeah. Sending an extra 3589 to the grid. Pay you back at 12 cents. So, you'll save the $1300 on the bill, and you'll get a check for around $430. So, cool. You don't have to pay anything and you're up $1700 a year.
Speaker 1:
OK.
Speaker 2:
And what your. And hey, like maybe, you know, the new stuff that'll probably increase your usage. So you have, unless it increases your usage by more than like half, um, you should be good cause it's making an extra 44% of your power. So It'll just increase what you're saving and like you know that check will go down, but I mean unless it's something crazy, I would still expect your boat to get covered. um, and worst case scenario, it's like, hey, you just get your 1st $1700 of power for free.
Speaker 1:
So the solar panel, are they gonna be facing this way, which, which direction will they face?
Speaker 2:
They don't, uh, they don't really face, um, anywhere we lay them, we lay them flat lay flat on OK, yeah, like, let me show you a picture. So kind of like this, uh, this is how most of the panels are put. We try to do it on a racing system. That's what keeps things, um, like operable too with, uh, the other things you have on your roof, and that's pretty much it. We don't make penetrations in like the membrane. We just attach it to the side walls here
Speaker 1:
because it's the most, yeah. So it's attached to the side walls in the front all the way to the back. Um,
Speaker 2:
For yours, it'd be like 2 arrays. For this would be 3 rays actually. And I would imagine that they do this like middle section with the bars, and then this one they could either do with the bars or the like like direct mount like stacking, and the back would for sure be the stacks because there's no paracut walls for it to connect to, um, and then that one would kind of, I don't know which one they would do, but
Speaker 1:
so this one's, how do they attach it to the roof. So I would get attached to the roof. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
it's uh, let me check. It is something like this. It's called Solar stack, and they go on these little mounts. And they just put the panels on top of those things.
Speaker 1:
And how are the the mounts attached to the roof?
Speaker 2:
It's like it's an adhesive. It's like uh like like cement super glue or something like I'll show you a picture
Speaker 1:
of uh so that's actually attached to the membrane then yeah
Speaker 2:
yes. It looks like that. Oh
Speaker 1:
yeah, I was there.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, there's probably a picture of here. And this was one where they were doing 100% of uh that mounting and then they put the panels right on top, and actually that's a kind of good picture of the, it's like an older system, but that's like how the racks work too. And yeah, that's how we go up there.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, um, do you guys have any houses that you've done on that street?
Speaker 2:
Um, I can look.
Speaker 1:
Uh, references of people that we can just,
Speaker 2:
oh just look online. There's like or or just look up any company or reviews, um, yeah, there's like everyone's like raving about it.
Speaker 1:
um. Remind me the name, I don't even remember the name of your
Speaker 2:
sustainable you. And let me find this is our install map. And we've done about 1600 of these projects. The, yes, the installer, um, that we primarily use solar solution, they've done about 6 or 6000 of these, and they've been in business for 17 years.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I'm familiar.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, if you looked into solar at all, uh, you've probably seen something with them, and I think. ripple them We're below Missouri 4th Street. I think we're right here, 4th and
Speaker 1:
Kennedy between
Speaker 2:
Missouri
Speaker 1:
and Kennedy.
Speaker 2:
So we have one right around the corner. And then uh little hand is me, and then the blue pins are a bunch of those. This is not updated very often.
Speaker 1:
And this would be sustainable you, not necessarily solar solutions, like solar solutions could have done any of our neighbors at a different time when like they were the ones coming out. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
or like maybe uh sustainable you did it and they put it through solar solutions or they put it through a different in solar. Um, I don't know, maybe it tells, I don't think it tells me. Which ones these are sometimes they have people's names. No, usually just has the address, um, personally. I, we installed uh this couple at the beginning of the year. uh, we're right there and then there you can probably see their house from here. I'm trying to remember
Speaker 1:
just there across from Longfellow. Yeah, uh, where is that 4th and Longfellow? Yeah. It's for Right here at the end of the street, if you were to cross on the opposite side of the street. Address is 401 Missouri. So cross right right here on the left side and besides that like pipe and the neighbor's thing like yeah that's how I I didn't see any obstruction here.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, they're, um, that's how I have it. So like that um section right there, that's like roof and like this is like a like an L. I've never I don't think I've ever run into that. If it's gonna do anything to our to our um
Speaker 1:
homeowners insurance, is that what you're asking? Yeah,
Speaker 2:
you're, uh, you're probably already paying for it. Um, if you, who do you have for your home insurance? It's like I'd be shocked if it's not your policy, and, uh, if it's not, it's like 30
Speaker 1:
dollars a year. What is it, what would it be covered under? You, you're saying you're probably already paying
Speaker 2:
for the insurance.
Speaker 1:
I mean, we yes, we of course have homeowner's insurance, but I'm asking, is there any impact to our homeowner's insurance that now we're gonna put solar on our
Speaker 2:
Oh no, it won't like, like we like raise your so
Speaker 1:
like something, I mean, everyone forbids. There's a fire, everything is completely gone and Don't do we, does our homeowner insurance have to cover the replacement? I mean, obviously that's not the act of God, that's something that happens for whatever reason. So does that mean we need to make sure our home insurance, home insurance will cover the replacement of the of the panels?
Speaker 2:
Uh, I mean, if you want, like it, it's already covered by the installer, um. So it's probably not necessary for you to do, but a lot of people do it anyway. It's a good idea to call them and like, say, hey, I'm getting solar system. Um, if for some weird reason it's not already in your policy, um, you can add it for like $30 a year. OK. And then it's like back up.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I'm just wondering, so for example, if you don't include that in your policy and something happens and your policy isn't enough, isn't sufficient to cover the additional costs of it,
Speaker 2:
liable for it or doesn't matter at all because like it's all on the installer you're paying. They're taking full responsibility. It's only it would only be as a backup. The that's the only flip if you, uh, if you're buying the system, if you're buying the system, I tell people like definitely call and make sure it's in your policy because uh if you buy it, it would first be your homeowner's insurance and then it would be installer for like acts of God, but for the free one, no, you don't, you don't have to do anything.
Speaker 1:
OK.
Speaker 2:
Um, but yeah, Madison, uh, Quijano, um, that's the one over there. I don't know if you've met them before. And a couple more over there, but no I'm like right next to you.
Speaker 1:
So is this, I mean, so ultimately PEO is not going to be supplying power to DC anymore at some point, it's that.
Speaker 2:
Um What do you mean?
Speaker 1:
Well, I mean, if, if, if, yeah, everybody goes solar or most people go solar, then the power being produced or delivered to DC by people we drastically reduce compared to today.
Speaker 2:
Well, they're, they're still gonna be making power. It just has to be renewable sources. So they're also investing in like, I don't, I'm not as involved in the other projects like wind, geothermal, and other types of things. Um, it's not like they're going out of business. They still will like, even if 100% of our programs are solar, they still have the grid to maintain it and like operate and that's like, you know, you'll still get a a PEO statement, but when you get your bill, Instead of the when you hand me, it'll be like negative KR uh values, and you'll be in a situation where since you're sending more to the grid, you're gonna build up a negative balance and have a negative bill, and then at the end of the year, that number will accrue up to like the $430 and then they'll send a check with your last statement, and then it'll just reset and It'll be like that as long as you have.
Speaker 1:
So we sell it to them at 12 cents per kilo. Is that what it is?
Speaker 2:
You get paid back for that balance at 12 cents a kop,
Speaker 1:
but when we buy from them, how much are we buying from them? About 16 OK and I think they just got new increases approved.
Speaker 2:
I think so because it happened in June, yeah.
Speaker 1:
OK, so they're probably just passing, you know, like sharing that information on the. Consumer. Yeah, so the 1st 400 kilowatts, um. 0.0146. And then the last. And then above that 0.034 and there's all these like it's, you know, it's like state
Speaker 2:
it's OK,
Speaker 1:
fees and I mean you know you get the first amount for a set fee and then above that you pay something a different cost like more per cost. OK, um, so what was it? What was the next step in in this process? I mean, we still need to discuss, right, um, so what's the next step? Do we have information?
Speaker 2:
You just send in an application.
Speaker 1:
OK,
Speaker 2:
and that's all
Speaker 1:
online.
Speaker 2:
Uh, I know that's, uh, that's just with me. Uh, we pull it out together, and then they come out, survey your roof, and then we do the permitting approvals, and then you get installed in about 3 months. It's, it's really easy.
Speaker 1:
So do we want to do the application because there's going to be a time period for them to review it or whatever and then see if we're approved and. Or do you wanna Um, have a discussion first and then Can we that application you be like come out to do that?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, just do it in person. It's like pretty easy. Um, I can show it to you if that yeah. I pull it out. Have you seen this picture? It's from the Euclid like zoom in.
Speaker 1:
I didn't know that you could zoom in on it, but I have um I have, I'm always like downloading these to put on my screen too just because I feel like I mean it looks like art, right? Yeah, that's where we live.
Speaker 2:
It's so cool. All right.
Speaker 1:
One of these days when we're gonna look at a solar system and point out that's where we live, you know, it's not like using a map, you know. Incredible. But he has like the whole thing downloaded. I can't think of the name of the, that's what I have on on my computers too. Not this one, but the older one.
Speaker 2:
Like from the Hubble,
Speaker 1:
um, not the Hubble, um. What's the one after the album?
Speaker 2:
Oh
Speaker 1:
yeah, yeah, yeah, those are, yeah,
Speaker 2:
oh man, uh, whose name did you want?
Speaker 1:
Uh, it doesn't matter. You can use what's your name? What if my name is, right? It has both of my names yeah. A K I N S
Speaker 2:
A I N S A
Speaker 1:
N Y A. Yes, that's right.
Speaker 2:
No, what's the best email for you?
Speaker 1:
Yimmy Y E M I underscore. A At hotmail.com.
Speaker 2:
And best number for you?
Speaker 1:
301-807. 86. You can use my 1486.
Speaker 2:
Thank you. Sorry about that. That's
Speaker 1:
OK. OK Mhm.
Speaker 2:
Can do better.
Speaker 1:
Right
Speaker 2:
Was he, it was 49/11 or
Speaker 1:
5511.
Speaker 2:
4th Street last. Address matches the city.
Speaker 1:
Mhm.
Speaker 2:
Oh, I'll have to um put it as it appears there too,
Speaker 1:
so. So, A D E Y E M I. So just in front of the Y EMI. A D E
Speaker 2:
And what was your middle initial? K And this is just agreeing to send it to your text and email.
Speaker 1:
Yes. OK. All right.
Speaker 2:
This application, it's a solar system lease agreement. Some people call it a PPA or a power purchase agreement, and it, this forces all your power to be free for 30 years or 20 years, and you can renew it for up to 10 after, and it forces them to take care of it. It goes over everything they're gonna do for you. Um, I'll show you the most important part, and this will send it to you too, so you can uh review it at your own pace. Um, it is construction, so like they are very thorough with it, and they explain each section of it. Um, but this is your rate for power for the 1st 20 years, and it's 0 cents coatt hour, um, for everything. The other thing is at the bottom, and this is the Uh, totals of everything you're gonna pay, um, it's 240 months, the total cost of this is $0 monthly payments are $0 your monthly payment, uh, each month through the 20 years is $0. If you, uh, somehow find a way to not be able to pay your $0 they're gonna charge you a $5 late fee, um, and the total of your monthly payments for the 20 years again is $0 and Um, they're just like really thorough, uh, saying it's free, and these are set up, uh, we do these in like Maryland and Virginia too, where there's no free solar, and they're signing up for like just like a lower electric rate, um, so there are things in there that like kind of like sound weird, like, like, hey, like the, the, um, you have to let us know if you can't afford your uh payment. So it's like if you can't afford $0 like you're gonna have to let us know. Um, and there's like a box that's like, uh, hey, like we're gonna like do a credit check, but like we don't collect any enough information, we're just like collecting your electric bill and sending this in, so there's, uh, uh, we can't like check your credit with that. I don't need your ID. I don't need your social security number or anything, um, that's pretty much it. But yeah, I can send this to you. Like, do you have any like questions or anything you you wanna make sure is in there so you're protected or
Speaker 1:
um, yeah, I think send it to us and then we can take a look at it and have a conversation and then um and then if we're OK with it, I mean it looks like you pretty much have everything you need already.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, oh yeah, everything, um, I would just take a picture of the bill, um, to like submit it, and then as soon as this is, uh, filled out on your end, uh, the installer, they give you a call the next day, schedule the site survey, and, uh, they'll come out and check out the house, and yeah, that's, um, that's pretty
Speaker 1:
much it. Did it allow you to send it? I know it's DocuSign, so typically you put in the addresses. I know you put in his address. Oh, I guess that's fine, yeah. Only, only one signer or 20,
Speaker 2:
um, you can do two signers, I think, um, but I it's it only has to be one. They don't really, as long as it's like someone that's, uh, like it could have been either of yours cause it just has to be matched like one of the names on the city records, so OK,
Speaker 1:
that's fine, yeah.
Speaker 2:
And then if either of you wants to be like primary contact or soccer or whatever, then you can like flip that around too if you want to. OK. But yeah, that's uh. That's pretty much it. Um, do you wanna like circle back tomorrow on it or I don't know, like, wait, what are you guys
Speaker 1:
you sent it already. It's gonna all he needs to do is sign it, yeah, and then maybe we just scan and email you a copy of the bill.
Speaker 2:
I got that. Take a picture right now. I'll save this up later.
Speaker 1:
Awesome. Yeah
Speaker 2:
And then, yeah, take as much time as you need. Um, we, we generally just wanna make sure people feel good about it, um. I'll say, uh, if like we're getting towards like install already and like you guys wake up one day and you're like, I hate solar, let's like not do this anymore, like, um, that's fine. Uh they'll like charge you back for like all the like permitting and stuff. So like we do wanna make sure like people feel good about it, um but um yeah, as long as you like free power and and everything they're gonna do for you then, you know, it usually ends up working out pretty good, so.
Speaker 1:
Cool. Is that an aura ring? It is. Yeah, how are you?
Speaker 2:
I love it. My sleep is so much better like um why do you think it's so much? Because I'm tracking it and like when I have a bad night I hate it. I like I like try to get get um get to bed the next day or or sooner. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
so what, what else, so is it, is it different from like having one of those smart watches, or what? Um,
Speaker 2:
it like connects to an app on your phone. I haven't had it the past week, so I've been lay on it. Did you use the
Speaker 1:
kit to sizes before you bought it? Yeah.
Speaker 2:
It's like I find that it's like I wanted it on this finger, but it's like kind of tight and like the, the size 10 was like way too loose and it's like I have to use like soap to get it off. But like, so that's why I don't charge it sometimes.
Speaker 1:
It's like you have to take it.
Speaker 2:
But other than that, it's like um so like what takes of he's talking about it. I wanna like like like someone's about it. I'm like oh my gosh,
Speaker 1:
I've been looking at that so I was like it's really cool.
Speaker 2:
It like checks your stress and let's see what it has on my sleep. Trans. Like updated it to sleep, OK. Let me go back to when my sleep was like this was. Or maybe it didn't think it was amazing. So this is when I started, um, I know it's kind of small, but like the, I was spending a ton of time like waking up throughout the night and like that's my thing.
Speaker 1:
I like this color is. That's the one that washes all the um. What's, you know, the thing that starts with the thing that you don't want those things to build up, build up in your in your brain, because those are the markers that they find in people that develop Alzheimer's, right?
Speaker 2:
I didn't know about that.
Speaker 1:
OK, but what it's called, it's um. Yeah, I'm not getting enough sleep. I can't remember all the words.
Speaker 2:
But it was like the white bars like how much time you spend awake and it's like I think I was spending like
Speaker 1:
7 hours. Your total sleep was 7 hours 11 minutes, so awake, 1 hour 13 minutes, that's the night.
Speaker 2:
That's what happens to me. That's like it's not good. I reduced it like here was like really good and it was like a lot more thin and my sleep was a lot more consistent and then like I got way off track there. But um when I'm on it, it's like I'm really paying attention to it. It's like so beneficial um and I definitely think it's worth it. Um, yeah, it's pretty sweet. It'll tell you like, um. What else will it do? It's, I, I haven't even like, like I use it for like meditating sometimes and there's like a whole social part of it. It can take your like VO2 max and like sense how much oxygen is in your blood, um, yeah, I recommend it. I have a, oh, I think you can get like, um, if you think, uh, I think like I wanna like I think I can uh send some, uh, like a coupon or something to like invite friends and then they get a coupon or something, yeah, let me know and I'll, I'll be happy to, yeah.
Speaker 1:
Oh man. No, I'm glad he's talking about it because he's been talking about it, but like he hasn't he hasn't dove into it all that much and I'm like, I kind of want one.
Speaker 2:
I like all I have is a necklace. I kind of want some more jewelry,
Speaker 1:
you know, or
Speaker 2:
something
Speaker 1:
to wear, you know, it's kind of cool. I really want something on this one. as opposed to like any of your other fingers,
Speaker 2:
um, not really.
Speaker 1:
I was like just the aesthetic of like this is the finger I think it'll look nice on this finger.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I was like I'll just, I, I, I think the different fingers like mean something I didn't want to put it on my finger because I'm not married. I was like I guess like it looks like a like a titanium. Yeah, that's what I that's what
Speaker 1:
I thought it was a real wedding band.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, I guess that's what I was not going or I was going for like that's why I got the black color, um, because I feel like it looks like, but it's not I feel like some people like Marcus has a black wedding ring, groove ring no, his wedding
Speaker 1:
ring looks like very like titanium or something you know like blingy. My dad went white gold. I was like.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I recommend it. Um, it, it's like really cool, um, to have, and like if you, if you stay on it, like, it's like, uh, really beneficial for the focus is sleep, and it's like from there, it's like, yeah,
Speaker 1:
I could probably just do wonders that I leave my phone downstairs. Oh yeah.
Speaker 2:
That's a big one. That's hard for me.
Speaker 1:
That's
Speaker 2:
if you if you find a way to um figure out how to motivate yourself to do that.
Speaker 1:
the shortcut. There's a car, by the way. Thank you. All right, thank you guys for stopping by. And then, uh, after we talk about it, I can just, we can, you know, just respond to the email and
Speaker 2:
Sounds good to me. Yeah, it'd be about, um, it's like 3 or 4 months install timeline. So if you get it done in like this month, I'd say like yeah, December, January, February, March, like sometime March or April and that's like right before getting hot.
Speaker 1:
So we'll see.
Speaker 2:
Oh man, you need it right now actually.
Speaker 1:
So right now. We have had it on today. Yeah, there are plenty of days that I'm like, why is it so warm in here. Like we haven't turn on the heat
Speaker 2:
when I came out.
Speaker 1:
I mean, we are in the middle of the block, so that is a lot of insulation, but we haven't turned on the heat and like if he just turns that on, this whole area can be nice and toasty. And even in the winter, like if I'm cooking in the summer, if I was cooking in the kitchen and you know how it gets hot when you're cooking. Like I don't have to turn off the regular air conditioner because that would be just how cool it is. So yeah, we, we can use it. We've been, so our, our monthly budget bill used to be like $70 a month and you can see like it went up to like $110.
Speaker 2:
That they'll do that like um we uh we
