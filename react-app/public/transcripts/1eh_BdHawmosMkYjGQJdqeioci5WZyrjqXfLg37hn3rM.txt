Speaker 1:
Oh yeah, we like we, we put it up on your report, yeah, OK, advocacy, but you know what that advocacy, I mean, you sell it. Yeah, so we're advocating here. I don't know. I felt like it was like a nonprofit like, hey, you guys should do like. You know, it's good for nature and yeah yeah yeah. I think, yeah, yeah, I thought you were like just like pushing for. Electrical, uh, I'm sorry, so for solar panel, but not necessarily selling. Oh yeah, like we very much do that too. Like we, we generally just wanna promote sustainability and just kind of evolve a consciousness where people are thinking more about like our choices and stuff. Solar is like the biggest thing anyone can do. So I know, yeah, I know, yeah, but like they were like, you know what I was always interested is like with the size of my roof. Yeah, it's like it never really cover 100% of my. On my, on my electric bill, yeah, it's more like I think they force it force it 70% something like that. Oh, you got it already. This is this is one of the other ones we're doing. I have it on another tab. Let me just. And Yeah, you're right on your roof it's like a smaller setting is a bit smaller. 1313, you get me 64? Yeah, you might be able to do more. Um, it would depend on the uh I need to put more on there, like the events here. Oh yeah, well, that's the thing though, um, I'm supposed to, can you like put them up? Like high enough so that you don't, you can go over the vent. Yeah, so a lot of times what we'll do is we'll take those vents and then if it then we can just cut them and trim them if they're just like little vents, a lot of times you can just trim those and then put it up like over them. So it's like instead of doing, oh wait, hold on, so you guys put them right on the roof, yeah. OK. Oh well, it goes on like, uh, what we like most commonly do is something like. This guy right here, so it's like on a racing system. And then that's usually not space, no space. I, I'm gonna want a bit more space. I talked to my roofer and they were like, hey, you know, actually if you raise this a little bit more, they can just work underneath. Can you raise this a bit more? Yeah, you can like raise the uh parapet walls and yeah. That can be higher, yeah. If you make it higher, I think you might be able to just put more because 64, I think my yearly was like around 10,000. OK, yeah, cause you can do like 6400 watts. What is it like kilowatts or something? I don't know the units, kit for the. Let me see what that would be, cause I know like for sure we could do that one, but if we can, if those vents are good to trim and like you don't mind uh trimming them. And it's like high enough where we can build up the parapet walls a little bit. We'd be able to do instead. And your and your software like looks at the light and all. I can show you how that works. OK, so I'm gonna delete these. What's Say there's no banks. Go to pain Yeah, I think they are maxed out on top. That might work. Let me try. Please don't, how are you? Let me string that together. Uh and then we send. OK Sure It's very similar like that. So, it takes, uh, like weather data from the past, uh, like 20 years we know like where all the shade is and stuff with the trees is like the liar. It is cool OK. So it's fairly accurate the way it's um. Oh yeah, if anything, it, it's pretty uh pretty conservative model, um, because it, it's 20 years old, yeah, yeah, so yeah, if we can get over those vents, then yeah, you could cover a lot more of your power, and I was curious too, is that section right there, is that like a deck or is there like oh, OK, yeah, but this. Is the top of this. I think there was a guy who like who put some in here, but I don't know. I think he might be shaded shaded. I couldn't see why. Cause yeah, people definitely, we were just talking about that. People definitely put um panels there. I wonder if I can just slide that over maybe, uh. Oh yeah I do that. OK That's probably about right. Oh, interesting. That's a recent picture too. Oh yeah, it's from, uh, it's from, oh man, like 17 days ago. Yeah, that's the kind of the least, yeah, they're pretty accurate. I wonder. Oh you don't get cereal anymore. So let me try. Yeah, you can for sure it too actually yeah. And uh. That Good. Tree there. the string That should give you a little bit of extra. And I get close to 10 as possible. Yeah, I mean, you know, 80%'s already quite a bit. Yeah, I started to like, um, like I'd say. Uh, like 10,000 kilowatt hours a year. That's pretty average. And like usually the uh average roof space like you have that extra like back portion. So it's like if like it was uh like normal size you'd probably be like sitting right at 100%. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, but 85%, 95% yeah pretty good. I mean it's better than So tell me uh about the, um, well you probably have a cost for this. Um, and, but the, you mentioned that the aris were going down eventually. That was a bit of a bummer, man. Well yeah, they're scheduled to go down because it's like, um, as there is more clean power on the market, like as they get towards the clean. Target like 8 years from now, it's just supply and demand. There's like the fines that PEPCO has to get as they reach the target they're getting fined less and then that's correlating to the value of what they're paying for PPO is getting fined because they don't supply enough, uh, like renewable energy. Yep. Oh man. Oh yeah, and last year they paid $1.7 million in fines because they literally can't install enough of this stuff on people's roofs. Yeah That's why they'll, I mean, that's why they'll, uh, pretty much there, they'll pay for the whole thing, and that's what most people do is, is free solar, so 100% of the cost covered, you'll never pay anything for it. They'll install it right up on your roof and I take how much of it. I think I feel like my So I'll all the the capacity like the electric electricity generated will come to me on a free.
Speaker 2:
Yeah.
Speaker 1:
Like 84, 54, so like you get all that. So yeah, you'd be, you'd get like your 1st $1300 of power for free, and then that's it. Anything you, anything you use over than that, it'll just be billed from PEPCO at like whatever rate they have at 16 cents right now, but your 1st $1300 of power would be free. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the. Basically, OK, and then the rest is there. Yeah, and it's like as long as you don't get up on your roof and start smashing it with a hammer, you'll never pay for it. Yeah, the ownership for these things? Yeah, the ownership, uh, you can totally pay for it yourself and then it's about like 5 or 6 year return on investment, so you could get some of that money back with the tax credit. I think that was the 30% thing that you guys were talking about and then I don't know. It's like, I mean it's up in the air. Anything could happen um but that's hard too like if you did Solar now it's based off the year that you get installed, not when you sign up. So if you did the purchase, like go ahead, do it, get installed sometime next year, and then, but you wouldn't get that 30% back till like 2026 when you do your taxes like a year and some months from now. You would get paid on power that you send to the grid, like every 1000 kilowatt hours you send uh with the system that you own, you're getting paid for, um, but it's like, you know, if, if you just like pay the $2000 or whatever it is for the system, and it's like it's gonna take like 5 or 456 years to get all your money back. And like, hey, if you're gonna be in the home for like, you know, if this is your forever home, like, yeah, do it because it's like that's the problem that's that's the question you're right, yeah, but like you don't wanna we need to consider if it's if it's a. we're gonna stay for a long, you know, long, long, long term or not. Yeah, cause it's like if you, you know, dump all the money into the system and then, you know, you have to move 3 years from now, it's like there's no point in doing it. But they like DC the S, yeah, that's, that's, that is the thing too. You're right. With the Sres, like right now DC it's like probably the highest in the country, right? It's like $400. 0 yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah kilowatt hour. And like how steep the decline is gonna be like, and when do you think it's gonna start decreasing? Because that's part of how you used to um calculate your return on investment, right? Yeah, so a trade. I can show you that right here. Oh, yeah. There is a schedule for this. So it's like right now. For November. Um, they've actually gone down since the summer a little bit cause it's like, uh, in the summer it's like 440, now it's like. Yeah, you're 15, yeah, even with respect to last year, yeah, and, um, so this is like the schedule of what the what's gonna happen, so for 2024. This $480 is the uh the SAP fine. That's like the opposite fine they have to pay. So every 1000 kilowatt hours of like dirty energy, they pay, they have to pay $480. Yeah, but if they pay you $425 for, you know, for the clean energy you make, they don't have to pay that fine. So as this number, this, it varies, it goes up and down, but it's correlated to this one which is like it's set this these are on the books and it's like next year go down, down, down, down, down, um. But that's where it's like, hey, yeah, like in, you know, 15 years it might, you know, be like the extract may not be worth it, but it's like you make all your money back at like you yeah I mean it's not gonna be 300, right? It's gonna be a little less. It's not 1 to 1, correct, yeah. It'd be like, I think in my um calculations that I use, I'll show people like like 250, like let's see, yeah. And like that that is also where too like uh this year like there were budget cuts that were pros like to like these programs and like they were, these were like looking at going like we were looking at like a 10 or 20% drop um in like for next year and thankfully there was a lot of support and push back on it and Next year, I mean they'll go down as they usually go down um but it won't be like, you know, 10 or 20% more but it's like the the local incentive like it is really good but it can be on the chopping block um if they decide to cut programs and it's like. You know, the, the purchase option, it can be really good, but you're taking all the risk, and that's why most people do the free one because it's like, you know, they're playing the long game, you know, it doesn't matter to them if they make all their money back in in 5 years or 10 years because they're they're looking at like the 25 year return. Yeah, yeah yeah yeah and. Energy that, that's right, yeah. But then, uh, you sell the house, how does it work with the With the panels when you are not, you don't own them. Yeah, great question. The when you sell the home, it actually works the same way with just like transferring it over. You're connected to it the same way you are with PEPCO. So, uh, I would be, I'm your personal representative like not only before you get installed but after. So you would just give me a call or anyone at. Will you, we'll get in touch with the new homeowner or your realtor, and they'll just sign like a half page form and then they'll get all the same benefits that you did. Yeah, if there's like, um, if you purchase it and like took out financing for it, you could like try to transfer the payment to them. You could like pay off the loan balance and like the sale of the home. I've seen people do that. Um, but about like 90 95% of just pick them up and move to another location. You could, it's like I've never really seen it done because it is like there's like a cost for that, and people want it on the house like it adds like 7% to your home value. Like Zilla just did a huge study on that and it's like if you ripped it off, like they'd probably just get another system so just sell the house for more and He adds how much to the home value. 7% on average. And that's like national average like where there's like some people get no incentives like they just spend 300 on the solar system and just get like yeah. Alright, so that configuration, I don't know if I'm gonna put the two extra panels on top here, but the one that you have maxed out, and if you have a quote for it, that'd be good. Yeah, I can do that right now, yeah. So let me take those off. Restrain
Speaker 2:
So let me ask you, did you guys see the pop up or did you guys buy the house like that?
Speaker 1:
No, we bought it like
Speaker 2:
that. OK, very cool.
Speaker 1:
Yeah,
Speaker 2:
yeah, and the deck too. Did you guys do that or you bought it like that, the deck, yeah,
Speaker 1:
no, it was like that. Oh we didn't do anything that was like structural to the house. I mean, we did some work, but they're building more of those, uh, the pop-ups. I don't know if you said there's a house. There's one over there too that did it. I think they started permitting it a little bit more. I think they stopped for a while giving them permits now looks like it's fine.
Speaker 2:
Is there a limit? Can you do like two pop-ups? Can you like 2 floors, or can you only do one it's,
Speaker 1:
I don't, I haven't seen more. They do it like actually. Um, if you go on Kennedy, they all used to be like row houses
Speaker 2:
like this,
Speaker 1:
and they build big, big buildings. Yeah, you can do more. Just the whole thing a couple of dig, dig you really have to dig, you have to dig, yeah. This house they do because you
Speaker 2:
need
Speaker 1:
to
Speaker 2:
increase the the stability of the house. Oh my goodness,
Speaker 1:
OK, cool, so yeah.
Speaker 2:
OK,
Speaker 1:
so for, oh yeah, those two panels there, they were only adding like 400 kilowatt hours a year. So it's like with this system 8,076 times electric rate. OK. So option one would like to pre-program, uh, pay no cost, and then immediately you're savings still like $1300 a year, and that's it. If you want to buy it. A system on the size for. Uh, 6.4 8 kilowatt system. Times. So some of this size would be about $21,000 and it's like if you're a cash customer, you pay the $21,000 and then in like like 5 or 6 years, that time you'd make about all your money back and then thereafter you're just profiting. And loans and all that. Yeah, there's financing, yeah, um, it's like not the rate on that. It's like 10%, a lot, and it's like that's why everyone knows the free solar because like you get immediate benefit of the savings and then you can always buy it in the future too, like yeah, there's an option to buy it at like year 6 that you probably get a pretty good deal on at that point and then go from there and You know, we even work with a lot of people, a lot of the purchases I set up to, it's like, uh, usually we just submit it as a free project, and then after we get like the final design and everything, make sure like, hey, like 100%, like we can actually do the design strategy today, then we'd like, so sometime before, you know, signing up and install, we just switch it over to a purchase and that's usually how I, how I do the purchases. Because you can, uh, yeah, you can switch it over to a purchase anytime for install, so yeah, and that way, like, you know, if you have your free application in, like, You're, you're good. Like if you submit it and then they get rid of all the incentives the next day, like you still get it for free because you took no risk. But if you buy it, you have until like it's like a month after it gets installed, they'll turn the system on and that's when your incentives lock in. So it's like if anything changes with the program from now until install, which could, you know, like 4 months maybe to Um, December 18th, 19, so like mid December, January, February, March, sometime in March, you just have to hope that like, uh, and then a month. Like by spring time by April that like nothing would change and also that's for the local incentive and then you have until like a year and a half from now to hope that nothing happens with the tax credit because they take that away if they reverse the inflation reduction Act and like you just won't get it and it's like. Yeah, yeah. All right, well, you wanna send me a proposal with
Speaker 2:
that,
Speaker 1:
um, if I just send an email. Do you have my email?
Speaker 2:
I don't think so. I don't start
Speaker 1:
put an email together
Speaker 2:
for you.
Speaker 1:
But think you like you like definitely wanna purchase it. Or uh, what's the best email for you? Uh M as in Mary, and Nancy, B O U T A G H O E. I got, uh, sorry, M N B O U T A. ATA not H. OTA GH. Oh Awesome. At gmail. Cool. I uh. And I mean right on time for my cleaning crew here. Hi, how are you? Please come in, come in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is
Speaker 2:
fine. For Oh that's good OK Hi, how are you?
Speaker 1:
You, uh, you spell your first name M O H A M. Uh, MED MED. And let me put that together for
Speaker 2:
you. Hi,
Speaker 1:
how are you? OK
Speaker 2:
Yeah Um And
Speaker 1:
Um
Speaker 2:
It's still quite a bit of savings,
Speaker 1:
man. What's up? It's still quite a bit of savings even without not owning it, OK. Do you think there's like an option that you'd lean more towards like doing the free one or are you like really set on, I think I need to talk to my wife about it, you're right. probably for go. But if I wanna, you know, look more into that, I'm just gonna ask about, um. Uh, the eventual purchase like after, so hold on, so once it's installed. And I don't own it right this evening. Once it's installed, it's after 2 years, I can ask you guys for a quote to buy it, buy it. Yep, like there is a, what I'll say I'm not like, uh, there is like a defined option at year 6 and that's like uh 6 yeah, they've made all their money back at that point. So it's like that's where it's like kind of a good deal if you, you could like after like your. like, hey, I want to buy it, but like at that point they haven't made like their investment back yet and it's like may not be as good of a deal. You can definitely offer to buy it from them, but they may like kind of like oh, hey, we're not getting like, you know, like 3 years of our return. They might just like add that to it so you can buy it. Yeah. But um, yeah, if you can swing the purchase, it, you know, it can be really good, um but uh we What I would say is like um definitely do one of them cause we like the last thing you wanna do is like wait to decide on it and then like next year they get rid of them and then it's like, yeah, the free one as long as you have your app in, you're you're good, yeah, all right. And um, is there anything else helpful that I could include on the email. No, I think I did the, I just said the design and then uh for purchase that's a quote and then the free program would be it's just free and let's see that that's do that. I'm gonna send that over. And then would it help if I just like, or I don't know, uh, do you know kind of like your timeline of like just wanna just think about it actually I was just sort of the project when you came to talk to me, yeah, so I, OK, well, we'll talk. I'll, I'll, I'll reach back out, um, you know, I wanna do it and yeah. Yeah, I think now I'm like I'm just to get that little incentive. I'll give you a man. It's the easiest one because like you don't have to mess with like financing or like all the um like it can be worth it for people, but it's like kind of like a side project, you know what I mean. And it's just not on anything. Oh yeah, it'll, well, it'll look better than that. I'll show you this where I go. So you'll still get the same uh statement from them. But it'll look like. This, so like all the like usually positive numbers on your usage, they'll start to go negative because you're feeding back to the grid and then for it might not be like this every month of the year because there's probably some months you don't get sun, yeah, but you'll build up a balance and like have like a negative bill. What with PEPCO, and negative bill with them, yeah, really, yeah, so I owe, they owe me, no, I owe them, no, they owe me one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so but they basically I'll go next month with there's less and all that, yeah, like it's like for your situation there will probably be some months where you're producing more power and then it'll look like that, but then you'll like draw from that another month. And like that's cool, yeah, if you ever got in a situation where you're uh using less than what the system's doing, they will pay that balance out to you.
Speaker 2:
Oh really?
Speaker 1:
Yeah, that's pretty cool. Yeah, that's that's nice,
Speaker 2:
but you can't, you can't
Speaker 1:
beat free solar. It's like it's way easy
Speaker 2:
and no, you're right, yeah, no, you're right. I see, yeah. Well, I think he just was something uh. Good good business today. Oh yeah, we got, we got a couple more runs. That's awesome. We'll leave it there like down here. Mhm yeah. Tons of people know about it. Some people are doing it, so like a lot of people have neighbors who have it or neighbors who like the thing is, everybody know that's free, at least you can do it. I appreciate it, man.
Speaker 1:
Take care. Thank you for your time. Bye. Have a good one.
Speaker 2:
So I got some
Speaker 1:
time
Speaker 2:
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I have to. My God, I was just like, these are better. I got really nice insoles in them too. Uh Well, we have to Yep. Yeah. Yeah. My usual um. I my doctor. Yeah, it doesn't. I do the same thing too, because like, I don't know if you heard about this, um, but Trump has already announced that he's gonna be cutting the even tax credits. Really? Yep. Oh, cutting them or like lowering them. And E Eman's fine too. He says he's like he's like, we will not be affected. He's like, will not be affected, but everybody else will be. Uh, it's good. Like it's good for practitioners.
Speaker 1:
Like, like
Speaker 2:
he
Speaker 1:
says like,
Speaker 2:
hey, there
Speaker 1:
should be no tax credit. Like it's
Speaker 2:
like
Speaker 1:
capitalism, like, like
Speaker 2:
make your product better, make your product cheaper like. That Mhm. So I brought that up too for him like when you're talking about it's like. Like, yeah, and like, you know, the other is here right now. Plus you're the way you have cool. And also it's like, I mean there's no guarantees or anything. It's like that it's gonna be here or that it's not, but like the chances are higher that it's gonna be lower than 100% than over here. So it's like it might be. And it's like, yeah, I think it's gonna be hard for me to do that so like
Speaker 1:
anything can happen and like, yeah, tell people that like,
Speaker 2:
hey, they, they like wanna cut these thing.
Speaker 1:
And like they're um.
Speaker 2:
What was the what was the other thing? If he does do a purchase, he like, he might want a price off too because he already looked at you. He might want a price shot you because we already mentioned in there he's like, he looked a couple of different things in like 189001.
Speaker 1:
Oh yeah, because they showed him, they showed him the first system. The first system I showed the 5.46, that's 18,
Speaker 2:
yeah. Oh, like I know that price because like I've sold a couple of purchases I know that, um, yeah, yeah, I, I, yeah,
Speaker 1:
maybe I should have said that like people are so stupid they don't understand that like, like more panels is more money. Like I'll show them like, hey, we're getting you more, more panels and more power and more incentives. They're like, but I don't, I want it to be the same price as the
Speaker 2:
other but that one was like less fucking panels. I'll, I'll price match them. It's like it's probably. So he. That's probably something like that, um, but also it's like, but if he wants to do like the upgraded version of it, it's like I know you mentioned like, you know, raising up the parapet walls if he does a purchase, who's doing that. ROI does that raising the parapet walls, he won't need to. He won't
Speaker 1:
need to. He was like
Speaker 2:
he was that's like,
Speaker 1:
he was like making up a problem that doesn't exist. Like
Speaker 2:
we would like, like we would just we would just chop the um. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
which those should be able to like I didn't, those look like ones that we chop on other jobs and it's like if we can do the carpet mount on there then
Speaker 2:
it'll be perfect. You won't need or solutions, yeah, they can do that. OK. So, but like, but is like, OK, if those were tall for some reason or if you really wanted them to be taller, do you have those character walls can you make the brackets taller? I think that's what they do because it's like, yeah, make brackets taller like have like a second set of brackets. I have like the first row and another set of brackets on top of the first row, and then, you know, yeah, I know there's there's like a building up process, but it's like we'll do that if we like need to, but it's like.
Speaker 1:
I don't think we need to and just like really raising them up like doesn't, it's not gonna affect the production like he's already as high as he could
Speaker 2:
do like, yeah, oh yeah, yeah, right, yeah, there's no way he's gonna he's like there's I really. I try to kill it on there and like and like and then you try to kill in there and so like let's look about it. It's like me and I like what you said like if you're gonna do anything, like don't do nothing. Yeah, don't do nothing like, you know, like you either one person is like a fun or or just like you know obviously, but like just do nothing. And that might be one like chances are higher than you just do nothing like like you just said, he was already burying like the project. But you you said at the end I was like, oh you work on street. I'm like, yeah, er, yeah, that's how I'm really like me. Everyone was like it's super easy like there's like literally no reason not to do it like and also on the Wi Fi obviously you only talked about preschooler until he came out he started mentioneduring him and I was like, kill, kill, kill, but the wife was already down. Or maybe I don't know, but I obviously I wanna talk to him. Yeah, so, uh, yeah. Yeah, we'll have to, uh, definitely follow up with that guy. They, they still get appointment like, like please set those like those are, those are so good. They like definitely don't close as much and that's like they're just like not as much in control but like. If anything, the,
Speaker 1:
the only thing that'll be hard with that one will be getting him to like focus on it because he seems busy and like hits.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, yeah, so yeah, definitely. So I'll, yeah, right on. Yeah. Yeah. Yep, I, I'm gonna go to, uh, Dollar General and, uh, pee, and then I'm gonna come back. I don't know if I I come back out here because I don't want to. Midday. I like as soon as the afternoon
