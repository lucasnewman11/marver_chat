Speaker 1:
Calls me by my maiden name. I don't respond.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, let me, um, I think I know. OK, first thing I'll check for that. What was your address again?
Speaker 1:
No worries, 916. 10th Street. Northeast
Speaker 2:
OK, let's see. Uh, so, a reason for that is when we submit these, the name on your application has to match city records, and city records for GC Property Quest says Sheryl Jackson.
Speaker 1:
Yes, because I boarded when I was single. That's OK, that's cool. That's me. I am Miss Jackson. OK, that's why he's calling me Miss Jackson. OK, so I will, I will call him back. Um, luckily I will have to be home on Monday because I'm sick.
Speaker 2:
Oh no.
Speaker 1:
But I won't have to do anything, will I?
Speaker 2:
Uh, no, I don't think it's like, uh, I don't, or when you call them back, I would just ask if they need, I don't think they would need like access to the inside of the home, um, they'll probably just come out and do it, um. And let me, I got your project pulled up here. Let me just give you like a quick project update well, cause if they're doing the roof work, you're probably about ready to be scheduled for your install. Um, OK, sure. OK. Got you right here. OK, yeah, perfect. Um, they're doing the roofco, it looks like Monday, I think that's the 31st maybe, or.
Speaker 1:
No, Monday is only the
Speaker 2:
24th. Oh, I see now. OK, OK. That was like there like it was just like a filler date they had in there. Um, yeah, once they get that done, um, you'll be put in the queue for installation. Uh, I don't know like how backed up. They are right now, but typically when they do the roof stuff, they do the solar pretty shortly after that. Um, so just look out for a call from Nicole or uh look out for like an email or a call from my assistant, Mark, and they'll find a date for you that works for the solar install.
Speaker 1:
If someone don't send an email because I might miss it. If someone could call me, that would be better because this way if it goes to my voicemail, I'll check it.
Speaker 2:
Oh OK, yeah, yeah, yeah, they usually send out a call that's like standard. I'm like training my assistant right now, so sometimes I'm having them do like email communication to start, um, but yeah, they'll they'll call you. Um, Nicole will probably call you.
Speaker 1:
All right, that'll work. Thank you, Paul, for your help.
Speaker 2:
I appreciate it. Yeah, is there anything else I can do for
Speaker 1:
you? No, I just want to confirm that.
Speaker 2:
Oh, OK. Well, hope you feel better from your cold, and I'll see you on Monday then.
Speaker 1:
OK, thank you dear bye bye
Speaker 2:
