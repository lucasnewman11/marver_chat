Speaker 1:
Yeah
Speaker 2:
Thanks for coming. Of course, yeah, so we'll go over that free solar here. Um, do you guys have a paper copy or like a email copy of your guys' um Pepco bill? No, but I can look it up. OK, cool if you could. Yes
Speaker 1:
You Tina
Speaker 2:
Pan, it's already written that there.
Speaker 1:
Oh, your email, oh yeah.
Speaker 2:
I would do that if you could email that over to me, I'll get the usage offer there and input it into the design here. Do So you guys heard about the free solar program before? I looked into it? Yeah, I mean there's been many years. Yeah, so we have so, but um, we, we know that you can either buy yourself and make money of it or you get it for free, but you don't make money, but you can get it. Yeah, is that pretty much? Absolutely. That's exactly how it works. If you guys do purchase it, and you guys will pay for all the power that's produced. If you guys do the free version, if you guys overproduce, like you make more power than they use, you'll get paid for the extra power that you guys. And if you guys underproduce, then you just get that amount of electricity for free, and there goes mhm. Yeah, pretty simple like that, yeah. Beautiful home you guys have here, by the way. I love all the art and decorations. Where did you guys get these masks from? Uh, it was a gift from South Africa. No kidding. That is so cool. It's letting me log in. Something's going on. Is this PEPCO an Exelon company? Is that what it is? Yes it is. Yeah, it says an error occurred when we're trying to process your request. Please try back later.
Speaker 1:
Let's start side down.
Speaker 2:
Uh No, the site is not, but when you click on slide sign in. The site is fine. Let me get off my BBS. Um.
Speaker 1:
Do you ever get a paper or a
Speaker 2:
copy
Speaker 1:
of the bill,
Speaker 2:
we don't, but I do have the, well, you know, we do have taxes. We did break it down. I did break it down so I can give you the, but you won't be able to see, but you'll need the dollar. You'll have the dollar amount. And what do you guys think you spent in electricity last year? Like I said, I can look it up. Hold on, give me one second. Let me go into my taxes. That's the easiest way to do it. Because I wouldn't know by heart, uh.
Speaker 1:
Never ran into that before
Speaker 2:
where like the site's down
Speaker 1:
and
Speaker 2:
can't pull it up um
Speaker 1:
if that's like the case um you can't just like get it like the next day.
Speaker 2:
Um, The spreadsheet is in our taxboard right? Uh 2024 tax documents. I, I'm in, but I don't see when I go here, I only see these two things. I don't see the spreadsheet, none of the stuff we gave him. I mean. These two things, uh, that's right, he just get rid of everything and he got one where like no, those are just like the all these. OK, so they
Speaker 1:
have a total number that's bizarre and you go to set a monthly estimate
Speaker 2:
year. I don't know, I mean. Wouldn't it be in your Google box one more time. Is Google Docs we use the Excel, right, or do we use Google Docs they use for the one you use Excel Google Docs or Excel. I use Excel for my expenses. That's fine. Is that what the houses? We can find it by the 18 cents. And it won't be exact but that's. Wait, we didn't do 2024. 0 no, no, that was 2023. That's why we don't have it. We are in 2025 now, so we definitely do. We have the 2023. You can use that for now. It
Speaker 1:
won't be perfect, but it can just give you a good idea. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
and meanwhile I can continue trying to get in, uh, Pepco. Co. Mhm And OK, let me see, I just got off my BBM maybe better. Um, This is so slow. OK, so electricity that 1500 a year. And you can see January, you can see every month. It's gonna be similar this year. This is 2023. So do you want me to email you this?
Speaker 1:
Um, that's fine.
Speaker 2:
We
Speaker 1:
can just kind of go off the
Speaker 2:
1500,
Speaker 1:
right,
Speaker 2:
and you can see the summer months. It's December too, a lot of it. December You guys have electric heat here. That's. Only if we had one on this is maybe we were using the electrical heat right then because we didn't have the renovations that a lot of work that could be I couldn't go back to when you go back to it could be the work in the basement.
Speaker 1:
And usually you gotta re-simulate.
Speaker 2:
Just to be sure
Speaker 1:
and
Speaker 2:
that's updated down. And then yeah, it's not. Mhm.
Speaker 1:
Did you do the uh. for the savings, yeah. Not just
Speaker 2:
It was in at. Just about the same we've we've been getting um we got a solicitor from. What Some dude came third party company, yeah, something, yeah
Speaker 1:
I didn't sign up for it, he,
Speaker 2:
oh he was trying and he's very aggressive. Oh man, very aggressive. Do you know who they are?
Speaker 1:
Yeah, we get it all the time like they're very pushy.
Speaker 2:
They're very pushy. And then when you sign some, I mean, I didn't, but I, I was like this looks soft. Let me check, um. I, I was able to do it. It was, it was, it was the brows. I went to edge and now I'm able to get in. It was, it was, it was, it was chrome that was me, um. I went to next door and Google it and sure enough the woman was like, yeah, I signed something and now they're like. They keep on following me and they're super aggressive and I don't know what it's just a third party, right? What what is it?
Speaker 1:
Well, they, uh, third party electric suppliers like clean choice. There's like there's like 40 of them. What they try to do is they're like, oh hey, like you can get all your power from clean energy. We're gonna actually ship you clean power from solar panels in New Jersey. And in fact, it's gonna be cheaper than what you're currently paying to Petco. Does that sound good?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, that sounds good. I wanna see my gas bill.
Speaker 1:
They probably have something to do with that too. But so they'll sign you up for like an introductory rate. So you're saving money and power that's yeah, 6 months or a year later you jack it up to like 40 cents or cents per hour. I can say how many bills I've seen last year. He's like they put this little section up and it's like an extra $100 this month and it's like people are happy to pay that back a little bit, but it's ridiculous the distribution charges and it's like why do that when you can use
Speaker 2:
the
Speaker 1:
free power directly from above
Speaker 2:
you you guys are smart, she, she got them at the door. I didn't, I didn't mean to, yeah, yeah, but she's smart.
Speaker 1:
And
Speaker 2:
the numbers that
Speaker 1:
I
Speaker 2:
put on an accent and I said don't, don't understand, don't understand. I said don't know, don't live here. No, and I just said, no, no, no, don't know, don't know. I, so this one, this is 141 this month is more. The other months should I look um it could be
Speaker 1:
one on the 3rd page of the bill, um, they put all
Speaker 2:
your
Speaker 1:
kit hour usage and that's the most helpful thing so these are
Speaker 2:
113. Yeah, and then will be 41113 and then OK, this is 200 in September 175, 193 in August. What is it? You want one of the big ones too, or
Speaker 1:
no, if
Speaker 2:
you go to
Speaker 1:
just the most recent, yeah,
Speaker 2:
that's what I did. I did just send you that, yeah, just the most recent. It could be the one this year too. My sister was giving us for this. Uh sure. Sure. Hm Sustainable dash you.
Speaker 1:
You know, most people uh I see changes so much like some years like if you have one in it and they go up if you. Start my bitcoin. It'll go up and get a new hot tub or something if people move out of your house, then it's gonna go down. If you do energy efficient upgrades, it's gonna go down and um that can, that's why sold are so much easier now because like before you're paying off for it, it's like you kind of gotta optimize it for like, OK, where do you, yeah, but since it's free, it's like he just get as much as you want and go from there.
Speaker 2:
If we can do it if we could do it, we right. I mean, so, so now you're gonna tell us how it works, to be honest, the one thing that I think maybe, and I don't know how that works with you guys, is the roof. I don't know what's the shape of the roof. Well, I mean last time we checked it was fine it was fine, right, yeah, and we, there was a company who was like once like years ago so we're about to do and they're like you need to fix some things which we did, we did, but then we did. And then they never followed up.
Speaker 1:
Oh, Martin, do you wanna talk about those sites or the next step?
Speaker 2:
So yeah, um, so what we do is, um, even if we even if we know that you guys need a whole new roof, we would always submit it as a free, uh, solar system. Uh, after you guys sign up for the free solar system, you know, free program, uh, a week from now, we will schedule a site survey. That's when they come in the house. They take a picture of your main panel, and they go up on the roof and take pictures and measurements of everything and inspect it to decide whether it's, uh, you know, deemed worthy of like holding the solar panels up there. If they come back and say that like it needs some work on it, like either a roof coating or a whole new roof, uh, we would come back and talk to you guys about options for that, um, because we have a lot of roof partners like uh one. Our main installers ROI construction. They started out as aro company 49 years ago and just started doing solar. So if you guys did need roof work, we can combine it all together and you guys a really good deal for the roof, uh, and then also the free solar as well. So if you guys need roof work, that's when we'll find out about that. And if you guys decide you guys don't want to do roof work and you guys don't want to do solar at all, we just cancel it, you know, I mean we would like to get it if we can, yeah. And how do you do because I mean, what if there's a snow up there? Like how do you still, how do you inspect it to be warmer next week, so maybe it should be fine I think.
Speaker 1:
They got a um a snowblower for when we're doing installs during the first snowstorm. Um, they can usually check most of it out even if there's a little bit of snow on it, it should be fine. OK. OK. There's, if there's like a fluid up there and then we
Speaker 2:
can reschedule it. And people do, I mean the bill is up right here, you get quite a reduction of the bill usually.
Speaker 1:
Well, it depends on where you're using like the one of the families I went with yesterday, he's using like 22,000 kilowatt hours a year. Average is usually somewhere between like 6000 and 12,000, so he's like double or triple. So he has electric heat. That'll get you. He has like 6 or 7 people living in this house. So, uh, that'll usually do
Speaker 2:
it. You don't have but it lowers your bill, yes,
Speaker 1:
because like all the, even if you put the minimum system size up there, you just get all of it for free. So it's like even like him, even though it's covering only like 30% of his bills, yeah, so they all go from spending like $4000 a year to like $1500 less than that. That's about a savings. So it's like, yeah, not when we're not gonna like help you win the lottery, but
Speaker 2:
anything
Speaker 1:
else you know.
Speaker 2:
What is expensive. Right.
Speaker 1:
Oh, you gotta learn how to split your tabs.
Speaker 2:
Oh yeah, can't do that. Oh yeah,
Speaker 1:
there
Speaker 2:
you
Speaker 1:
go.
Speaker 2:
Yeah.
Speaker 1:
So you see what they're doing with the uh inflation reduction Act.
Speaker 2:
I mean there have been so many things to see.
Speaker 1:
No, it's hard to keep up, yeah, they, I forget what happened, but they shared it in like our company's chat, um, they like paused it, um, like. What is it? The good news is only like 30% of the funding from this comes from the inflation Reduction Act,
Speaker 2:
OK,
Speaker 1:
and as long as you got your application in, you're like locked in, but where is this? They freeze it. So they freeze it, so like all the funding like not just for like clean energy projects um like everything is like frozen right now and they're gonna like vote on it and stuff and I, yeah, I, I think we're gonna be fine because like even on like the Republican side it like creates so many jobs and like red districts that it's like if they got rid of the whole thing then it's like, you know, I think it's it's yeah.
Speaker 2:
A lot of this being done for sure.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, so hopefully everything's fine. If they do take that away, then it might put this program in jeopardy. Um, that's why we've been like doing like so many of these. That's why I'm like having Martin help us out with like a ton of these too because. Like our business has like tripled since like December and trying to get in as many as possible, yeah, because it'll only affect new applications going in, so um for this one in, yeah, yeah, and we, that's what we're here for. Get like super easy for you, um, but if you know anyone else that um could you could introduce us to Lizzy yeah, yeah, um, maybe we can hop on a uh speaker call or something, um, before we go.
Speaker 2:
I think I mean they're pretty big the restaurant business so it might be better to text them. Oh
Speaker 1:
yeah, OK, that's fine.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I'll, um, I have your text, right? So I, I can ask them and share with them. Yeah, yeah, just uh save my number in there as like Martin Solar so you can like look up Solar and just put us in like a group chat together and that'll be the best ways we'll just get him the info. All right, I got your uh system here finished with you guys' usage. Here's what we're looking at uh 16 panels. And then here will be your annual production from the solar, uh, 6,792 kilowatts. So what I do here is I'll take that amount to 6,792, multiply by Patro's current rates at 18.5 cents, and then, uh, do the math on there. It comes up to about $1,262 of a savings that you guys would get from the solar mhm. It looks like this says it'll be covering. 66% of your bill there. Yeah, that's great.
Speaker 1:
Awesome. Are you guys gonna be around sometime next week for the inspection? OK, we can find a a good day for you and.
Speaker 2:

Speaker 2:
I know my family's from Michigan, OK. Monday night to watch. I was I was the whole the whole the whole season. I was like going for Notre Dame and then I watched their loss. Everyone was like they're they're gonna push them back 5 years. No one's gonna want to go. They're done, are over. One and only loss. It was bad.
Speaker 1:
They did so good.
Speaker 2:
I know, I know. I mean, you know, I'm from a family that was like, you know, rooted for the Lions forever and they never did anything. We also were Redskins fans growing up, so yeah, it would have been a cool family party to go to, right? Yeah, but then, I mean, what part of Ohio Michigan are you from? Akron Canton Akron, yeah,
Speaker 1:
same hospital as LeBron James and Seth Curry, but I didn't get the basketball skills.
Speaker 2:

Speaker 1:
You can also request these to be filled out
Speaker 2:
um after this medicine.
Speaker 1:
The contact info. Like on that
Speaker 2:
first page. Oh yeah, yeah, of course,
Speaker 1:
yeah, you just gotta put their contact info on it. And extend that box out so it'll actually populate the name on it.
Speaker 2:
and then address that text box. Mhm. And then my phone number.
Speaker 1:
You can put those all in one. Like I, I just do that as two just so you know there's two things that go there

Speaker 1:
You can either enter them in now or enter them in right before you have them then we'll sign off on it.
Speaker 2:
OK, yeah, up to you. I know Have you guys been with the company very long?
Speaker 1:
I've been here about 1 year now. I've been in solar for about 5 years so, um, I was actually about to quit the industry before I came here. We both worked in solar in New Mexico, um, so that's how we knew each other, um, before we came here, and one of my other friends who's been at the company for a couple of years. Like always told me how good the programs were here and it's like oh it's like really interesting but like never made sense to move out and then the company in Mexico is like not really good situation anymore and I was like OK I'll I'll give just like one last shot and best decision of my life like it's been like. So great to like help so many people and it's way easier here. Like solar in any other market. It's like, hey, do you wanna take out like a $40,000 loan so you can save $10 on your card. Yeah, it's the only place in the world where you can get something that's for no cost, and that's why we're trying to get it for as many people before it goes away. But even, even after that, like it's still gonna be an amazing market like there still be a great deal like, um, and that's where uh I love how like DC where everything's so progressive with the, um, like clean energy targets like everything they're doing not only for solar but like for electric vehicles like other home upgrades, um, it's a really exciting time to kind of be in the clean like tech field, yeah,
Speaker 2:
I. And then Gregory, since we're putting this in uh your name here, uh, could I have your phone number and email? Sure, it's uh 202-340-0376. My email is g and my last name is F E R. AND at gmail.com.
Speaker 1:
That'll put you as primary contact. Um, we can put, um, anyone's though, but if you're gonna be in primary contact then, OK, and you said
Speaker 2:
oh OK, so that's that's my fault. I always get those mixed up. Js and Gs with me for some reason. I mean they had similar and then 3400376 perfect.
Speaker 1:
OK, and on those ones too, um, so that'll be um sent to your email.
Speaker 2:
If I need to see
Speaker 1:
if, uh, one wants to put it in their name and then sometimes they'll put it in their name because it's just their name on city records, but the other, the one that's not on city records, wants to be primary contact. You still keep like the name and address the same as city records, but whoever wants to be primary contact, you can just put their number instead. It's like, OK, like, you know,
Speaker 2:
um,
Speaker 1:
it's gonna say like the other person's name, um, but it'll go to your number, and people are usually fine with
Speaker 2:
that makes sense. OK, so we should be good here. Yeah. And it's not.
Speaker 1:
Just that one and then after. Sounds just got your email.
Speaker 2:
That's right

Um, this is the zero cent rate form. Uh, they just have you put your initials on it, uh, for publicity that way like you can, we can take a picture of it, put it on our website, uh, but we don't like put on any of your info out there, and then they just have you sign at the bottom, and Martin will have that pulled up for you right here.

Speaker 2:
you just stay warm.
Speaker 1:
And then cool.
Speaker 2:
So they have a solar solutions with their friend Terry, whoever that is. So, OK,
Speaker 1:
it should pop back up here um and then just like download it, uh, download the bill and then upload them to the install
Speaker 2:
them they didn't it yeah. But 2 Mhm Look at the photos from that email that you sent me about the, the camp. Look at the picture. Who's in the picture? Zoom in. I didn't even realize. OK.

Speaker 1:
making sure it matches.
Speaker 2:

Speaker 1:
no, there's. If the name doesn't match the the city records doesn't match the um. Bill or if it's like only one to know their names is on records, but there other names on the bill um sometimes it's like that you would select a name doesn't match and then they would fill out there's like uh extra form we send in back says like oh hey like they both live there like oh hey this is like this person's mom or like it's like a relation letter and um sometimes it's like the same person and say like I um. Last Saturday, Terry D. McDowell signed up, but on City Records his name is little wrong. It says Jerry on City Records, so I had to submit this Jerry and we'll have to send in like a form that says hey, like Jerry and Terry are the same person.
Speaker 2:
OK Or anything additional documents
Speaker 1:
and you can just get that when um you get to
Speaker 2:
stop. And then go yeah

Speaker 2:
Do we need a picture of uh your um ID I send this downstairs and or a passport apparently we can do a passport.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, passport. I think I only did 2 passports last year, but it works with the IDs in handy.
Speaker 2:
OK Is it yours? Mhm. And Anything that's No,
Speaker 1:
you're good. And then once it's ready just hit
Speaker 2:
schedule. Yeah.
Speaker 1:
And sometimes it takes a minute
Speaker 2:
to load.
Speaker 1:
Alright, once this comes through, you'll get a text and the email with the calendar invite, uh, from ROI the installer. They'll send a reminder out for next Friday as well. There really won't be any news till then, um, but you'll get an email from James Sheets. He's our client success manager. He sends out a bunch of the updates throughout the process and, uh, Martin's probably. The best person to get in touch with or anything. Um, I did write, um, I need new cards too. Uh, I just got a work number, so that's a good number to reach me, and then Martin's on the back, and I would just reach out to him if you need anything. Uh, you might hear from Nicole at the installer. She takes care of like scheduling. There's like another lady that takes care of scheduling things. Um, you might hear from. Uh, Cody, if there's anything on the roof, uh, you might hear from my assistant Mark if there's any like admin stuff or just like really easy stuff that we need to get from you.
