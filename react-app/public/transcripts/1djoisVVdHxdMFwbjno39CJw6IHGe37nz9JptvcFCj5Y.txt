Speaker 1:
Hello mom. How
Speaker 2:
are
Speaker 1:
you?
Speaker 2:
Good, good to talk to you.
Speaker 1:
Oh thank you. I was trying to sign the DocuSign, but I had a question, uh, it's that small generative facility contract? See it says certificate of completion form.
Speaker 2:
OK.
Speaker 1:
So I'm wondering, um, nothing's complete, so I'm confused on signing.
Speaker 2:
Oh, that makes sense. Uh, almost everyone asks about that. So throughout the process, we, there's like a ton of like approvals we have to get, like we have to send everything to PEPCO, we have to send everything. to the city and get permits instead of going back and forth with you guys like 10 times throughout the process, they just have you fill out all the necessary stuff on the front end when you enroll so that we don't have to like be going back and forth, back and forth. Does that make sense?
Speaker 1:
It makes sense. Yeah, OK, OK, thank you. I appreciate it. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
was there any other questions you have before you sign off on it?
Speaker 1:
No, I think that was, that was basically the one says he's fairly comfortable.
Speaker 2:
OK, sounds good. Whenever, uh, whenever, um, you're done with it, uh, just let me know or let Rasheed know and he'll let me know. And then the installer will be, I think I have his number as primary contact, um, and then the installer will reach out to schedule the initial inspection date.
Speaker 1:
OK, thank you so much. I know it's kind of cold now but
Speaker 2:
oh no, it's OK. And your name was uh Glenda?
Speaker 1:
Yeah,
Speaker 2:
pleasure talking with you, Glenda. Let me know if you need anything else, OK?
Speaker 1:
OK,
Speaker 2:
bye bye. Bye now
