Speaker 1:
Yeah, I mean, it was, you know, I worked for a couple of people off the Northwest, and I think back then it was like $50,000 but if you got free electricity. From that point on. Then it was work,
Speaker 2:
yeah. And that's where, you know, it's like, hey, you can still do that. You can go out and buy a $350,000 solar system and there's like some cool incentives you get, but it's like almost no one has that line around and the interest rates are like. Not great either. So it's like if you, I tell people, hey, if you can swing the purchase, do it. There's some cool incentives, but what probably about 90% of my clients do is the free program, and that's where sustainable our organization comes in. We set this program up about 2-3 years ago and uh they pay for everything and you just get the free power and if you send you say free power
Speaker 1:
how
Speaker 2:
much
Speaker 1:
are we talking about? I'm I, am I gonna have a free electricity bill or I'm only getting a percentage? That's your
Speaker 2:
question. So it depends house to house and it depends on how much you're using on the electric bill. Do you know like what your highest usage is usually or like what your highest bill is in there?
Speaker 1:
No, I.
Speaker 2:
Uh, if you have a bill, that'd be really helpful.
Speaker 1:
I was gonna say probably a highest bill would be right under 3.
Speaker 2:
Uh,
Speaker 1:
You have I like everything else is doing that.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, oh, we
Speaker 1:
can't
Speaker 2:
do
Speaker 1:
anything
Speaker 2:
about the water unfortunately, but you
Speaker 1:
know
Speaker 2:
what,
Speaker 1:
I'm talking about when we got married 30 years ago and I had my house, we had this house. And we would compare bills and the water bill would we would get get I think 3 months.
Speaker 2:
3 months.
Speaker 1:
much Yeah let me see We get a lot of baby now and stuff like that. You got a little. every 3 months $40. Well, yeah, I wore the other day is what like 200, about 100. every month.
Speaker 2:
On the, on the electric side last year around this time last year, the average electric rate in DC was like about 15 or so cents and then now it's like 18.5, so it like went up a couple cents and it's like they passed 100 they asked for a $190 million increase last year, they got approved for a $124 million increase this year. So it's tripled over the past 20 years, but it's not just gonna triple over the next 20. They have to upgrade the grid.
Speaker 1:
Oh yeah, I didn't know if that was like the mhm
Speaker 2:
you wanna see something crazy. This is. Mm I don't have no 00, I didn't not see that.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, Apple mix I know I
Speaker 2:
OK Yeah, it's probably the other side I think. So do you have the I can so
Speaker 1:
Wait, what,
Speaker 2:
uh, full, full off hours here and the first one. Yeah, I think I just asked, uh, do you, do you have electric heat here?
Speaker 1:
No.
Speaker 2:
It
Speaker 1:
up.
Speaker 2:
Do you use like electric heaters at all? Oh, OK. That will do it. Your usage is a lot of people it'll go like up in, it'll go like up in the summer and down in the winter. Pretty much all over the time.
Speaker 1:
Yes because it's so cold.
Speaker 2:
Mhm, I put it on. Mhm.
Speaker 1:
I have a 10 kgs for the. Mm Yeah I totally like I mean.
Speaker 2:
So thingy I feel I uh. I mean,
Speaker 1:
and still I'm running the. OK, do you have to run it to what you saw. Yeah, 3,
Speaker 2:
yeah. 50, 16,000 kiatt hours. Mhm yeah. And which looks like Looks like that was more than the year before. You put to uh come through on here. So 263. You said
Speaker 1:
that
Speaker 2:
he How much she increasedent on electricity since January 2001.
Speaker 1:
I don't, I don't even try to get. You know Oh no he said how much do you think? Oh
Speaker 2:
yeah, we don't have to do you
Speaker 1:
know what I, I was thinking I wonder. Cheaper that there was.
Speaker 2:
Well, 20 years ago the average was about 6 or 7 cents, and yeah, so if you're using 16,000 kilowatt hours in a year and you follow the uh rates that have gone up since 2001, you spent about $46,000 or whoever's um. Uh, then in the home has spent that much on the electricity, uh, assuming the usage hasn't changed too much. The problem is, um, that rate, if the rate of change is a little over 4% a year, keeps going how it does, you're not just gonna spend $46,000 in the next 30 years, you're just spend over $100,000 on power if the rate of change doesn't change. And that's why they um push clean energy uh so much here because it helps a lot and. Helps everyone. So your, your benefit with the preprogram, right, is you get all the power from the system for free and I'll find out in fact how much that would affect your bill. But you don't have to pay anything, you'll never have any payment information to us, there's no credit check, there's no income requirement, none of that.
Speaker 1:
So what happens if I have to do something on my roof where I have to do the roof repair or something like that? Who's to to move those panels?
Speaker 2:
Great question. The, so CMU, part of my organization, we are partnered with pretty much all the installers in DC. The one that I've done for some insults around here, and most of the insoles we do is a roofer. So what we do is we come out, we take the panels off, we do the roof for you, and put the panels back on. There's a, it obviously isn't for you to pay someone to take the panels off, but because we're there for both projects, usually it doesn't end up being more expensive than the, um, like a roof without the panel, the roof without the panels. And I would just say like, hey, for those 30 years of free power, um, just that section, probably just like one of those years of savings we'll go to paying for the um removal and reinstall costs.
Speaker 1:
So you, so you're saying that, that y'all will pay for that? No, I would have to pay it back.
Speaker 2:
And that's the best part, cause like you're not gonna have to pay much more than an actual work.
Speaker 1:
So you're talking about 20,000 miles.
Speaker 2:
No, oh no, no, no, no, no, it's like
Speaker 1:
no, no, no, every group around here. Oh, no, to remove the, right, how much would it cost about he said no need to have a roof repaired,
Speaker 2:
maybe no more than 10%. 10% or what like extra than like what a normal roof cost, but it's like I don't know what kind of roof you have. I
Speaker 1:
don't know mhm and if you do have a,
Speaker 2:
OK. And that's totally fine and like it also depends on how many panels you have because it's like a bigger system or if there's like a different rapping model that's used like that's a good question to ask because you wanna make sure it's gonna be like good for you. You know like you don't want like hidden costs, right?
Speaker 1:
Right, got you.
Speaker 2:
So, um, we try our goal is to make that process as easy as possible for you. So whenever you you need a roof redone in the future, we just have the installer do it because they're also a roofer. They usually get like a good deal on the roof because they're making their money from the solar and usually all balances out.
Speaker 1:
About how long does a needles? They last about 34 years.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, do you know when you had your last one replaced? Oh, so good to go. That's not something you have to worry about like 20 years from now.
Speaker 1:
Well it's still, it's gotta be coded. That's why I'm asking questions because it's still gotta be coded, yeah, it still gotta be treated. Oh no go.
Speaker 2:
We do codings all the time. Those are easy, um, and we can usually get funding from this program to cover those costs. So if it needs a coding or if you want like a stupid good deal on a roof coating before the panels go up, just to like max out that extension of the life on the roof, I don't think that'd be a bad idea. And. Yeah about 15 months. Let me see what How many pounds of Because we work with a roofer,
Speaker 1:
uh, because we work with a roof. Well, I have, I, I have a roofer. I know, but what I pay to have this put on, there's no way that you could that that can do it for that price.
Speaker 2:
For only 20 g, this would be like 8 or 90 if you pay 200
Speaker 1:
for 20 grand for it I'm just saying that's what the average group the estimates that I've got has been up to like 18 to 20, a little bit more than 20 depending on. I with a bigger company but the person that I went with for for my roof. Uh, we're not. No, no, no, for the root they're taking 20 g we got. That's if you go, if you go like, um, well, I didn't do it, but my neighbor that street was long as long and since they went to 29,000. And so what they told her is that if you sign a day we'll knock off 10,000. So I told her, you know, they were trying to screw you from the beginning. If you tell me, and that's, this is, this is the way I think, if you tell me, well, Mr. Davis said, if you sign a day I can knock off 100, that means you're trying to screw me in front of the beginners, you know, so I, I don't want to. I I don't wanna deal with you at all, you know, I don't care if you go down to 5. I don't wanna deal with you because you already showed me the differential, right, so this is now, yeah, yeah, no, what I was what I was gonna say though is that because the solar panels that we have are also when they do they're very sensitive to not doing it in a way that does we let's say if I went with your panels we gonna have a. We're gonna have a situation because they redo this house that door and so our roofs overlap, you know what I mean, we got a prayer wall in between, but Um, I gave him permission to overlap or to. Make sure that that therapy wall didn't leak, you know, so I don't know if, I mean they really can't have no issue because we, we go whatever that wall is we can go have the distance in that wall, you know, um. Um, So probably
Speaker 2:
right. And what I do for um all my clients. So one reason, one of the things that that installer does. they use a mounting practice that is zero root penetrations they go from wall to walls. So uh so yeah. They do it uh direct now, so you can do it wall to wall and put the. Like you could go like. You can be You could do it like this. Mm. This is how it would be with beans and like you see so I put it on there and you get this system that. This one like that, and then they can use like half of the from the walls, and they went over half the food.
Speaker 1:
Well on this wall is all right if they had to because this is my this my wall goes all the way up the house over here doesn't it stops showing way showing.
Speaker 2:
Well that's they still go halfway because I didn't prevent your neighbor from being the rails. I get done for here.
Speaker 1:
Well, that's what I'm saying over here, this house is a smaller house, so this house probably. Next door probably only go up maybe to my the top to this to this group here and as far as the house goes so this no here we got the same wall.
Speaker 2:
So this is one of the um. We had a root over. And I just wanna show you why I think that 20 grand is crazy because we would do a full roof over. So I said like 7 or 8 grand would be more standard. They're taking like over 100s of profit like when they're quoting them out.
Speaker 1:
says the code
Speaker 2:
the
Speaker 1:
code, the code
Speaker 2:
we have to quote it. I can try to find one that's like similar, but that's one that like we can um. Like they, they probably do it for you for like $50.
Speaker 1:
I got the price of 9.
Speaker 2:
No We can get down to that for sure.
Speaker 1:
So so let me so let's get back to the panel. So we, we put the panels up there. What is it gonna cut my electricity? Yeah, I like a lot. I mean because like right now. I So I just take 2 months. But when I'm chewy, my daughter and him, they're not chewy.
Speaker 2:
Do you think does the house like that, uh, ventilate for your wall? I know some people that travel with like, oh, it's like always gets really warm here, but I can never get it warm here. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
it gets really warm upstairs.
Speaker 2:
You Mhm.
Speaker 1:
I mean there's areas that like back here there's no heat back there because that that used to be a back porch so there's no heat, the heat stops here. So if I close this door and that door over there, it would heat up pretty good.
Speaker 2:
Did you guys the top from the porch?
Speaker 1:
Yeah, it was converted from a screen in porch to where we didn't, it was done way before. We got here. Almost done So you know the you know the size of the house?
Speaker 2:
It looks
Speaker 1:
like
Speaker 2:
Um, I could find out. I know the, I know the I know roughly the dimensions of the stops of the pants would go. Um
Speaker 1:
There have been complaints about. Um, where the panels are, like when it rains heavy, or heavy. Only, only on um a frameworks that have problems. A frame because on a frame they deal that they drill directly into the shingles.
Speaker 2:
And the ones that go to houses go like this,
Speaker 1:
they have problems.
Speaker 2:
No that's why the solar set thing I mentioned is uh really good because we make uh with that design. He Even Um, we can only do the zero risk penetration.
Speaker 1:
On what? Yeah, I've seen people get uh solar panels put on and the roof. Yeah, and then, uh, one lady, she had solar panels on and she went, they took them off, they took them off for free for her to get a new roof put on, and then when they went to put them back on, they charged her they want to charge you like $1400 to the panel back on, you know, so.
Speaker 2:
And that's pretty standard. I know that like some companies like that might have been solar solution um like they used to have uh like hey we'll come out like one time. Yeah, 13. The reroute. I don't, there are some consolers we're not partnered with, but I'm not aware of anyone who does that. And that's like the benefit that they like go down at the time and that's where like it'll just continue.
Speaker 1:
How long were those males of both the legs?
Speaker 2:
That's really good part too and also like on equipment and practices and stuff because I know you don't wanna um into some of those situations they passed the sustainable 2.0 DT plan and they actually managed it the type of equipment that we put on and how we do it and it takes like this stuff but even if you really wanna get solder, like you gotta wait like months to get it because you gotta go through all the permitting and regulations and make sure. But if we have the wrong color zip ties or if we have a sticker like image somewhere they like it to be but they redo everything so it's like extended how long it takes to get these done, but more people get a better, uh, product and service and less of those issues back from like the wild west of things to do. And To answer your question on What to. And I That half is electric. 263. It So this year 2030, they signed about $3000 in electric if the rates don't go up, so they passed a $124 million dollar rate increase, so it'll go up maybe like 150 cents to say 18, so at least $3000. This system would produce like just over that. Let me show you. So you have these masks based on your root, if you fill up the whole thing. You know That's the production and it's like 40 hours above what you're using, so you would get. 100% of your electric charges covered. You still gotta pay the the customer fee, the um Pepco fee like you won't get a zero bill, but
Speaker 1:
it'll go down to $16 to go down $16.
Speaker 2:
It'll go down to $16 plus
Speaker 1:
like whatever the tax it'll go down to $16 or it'll go down $16 to $16 plus whatever they're charging you. Well,
Speaker 2:
that, that if you get all your electric, uh, covered, if it all balances out, the only net thing that you'll pay is the customer charge because all the other fees are charges now.
Speaker 1:
1608, but what if they got, you got an energy charge?
Speaker 2:
Can you see how all those charges are like notified by the payout hours. It's like, hey, this rate it's not the what hours. You, you'll be getting net all your power from the system, so that's it's 0 times the like whatever 7.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, but I, I, I, I mean, I, I'm here, I hear, I hear what you're saying, but I hear those stories about, uh, they still got to pay $150 and stuff like that. Oh yeah, you know, so I mean,
Speaker 2:
let me say this. So one of my clients just called me up on this one. And he was angry and he called me and he was like, hey, I just got my electric bill. And I'm still, I still had like a big bill, and you told me I was gonna get all my power covered like what happened? So I went over to his house and I got his bill. And I took a look at it. And I pulled back up the system. And So looks pretty good, right? 1000% offset, so they'll spend 20% extra for the grid. Any anything extra they pay for to jump out, um, but it was December and he still had a bill, and that's when he got installed in his system came on. Well, if you look at how it balances out, I'll try to zoom in here about it freaking out. So in this December month. Please. I go to my desktop. Mhm So for December, that was huge uh darker orange bars. Is what the that he's using and the solar is like doing nothing so you still have to pay for all that, but what I told him is like, oh dude, you're getting screwed because like you got your system got turned on this month, so it actually produced more, in fact, it produced more than we like projected it to with a small, but he still had a bill the that month his so isn't doing much. It was snowy, and he usually uses a bunch of them. So what happens will happen next year? Is This month he'll still have like half his bill, and then this month they'll go down to like like a 1/7 of the bill, and then he starts overproducing. This is the goal is what all the sols doing. He'll send a bunch back to the grid and you'll also have a negative balance on your bill at that point. And when he gets back to the these months next December, instead of that usage from the power company drawing from his bank account, it'll draw from those credits that he sent them. So on the year, the system in 10% more than you, it landed at different times, but he just got the short end of the sick this December because he was turning on this month where his system didn't do much and he didn't have any credits built up.
Speaker 1:
So he just got to put it in.
Speaker 2:
OK?
Speaker 1:
He just got his system put in in December. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
so just think that
Speaker 1:
I
Speaker 2:
did
Speaker 1:
if if it was on January, April, I mean January, August, I mean, um. June, July, August. OK,
Speaker 2:
and that's like if I didn't catch that, he could have like went online and like been telling everyone, like he, he sent me a bunch of girls, he's not gonna do that, but like that's like, you know, you hear a lot of stuff and I try to keep it simple, um, but yeah, it does like kind of depend at some point and like for your, let me pull off like what yours would look like. And So about Um,
Speaker 1:
So I mean like right here they got energy charge. The charge is $173.44. So what is the energy charge?
Speaker 2:
So on that Mhm. Energy charge. So for this month is 1,659 kilowatt hours and that is times this rate per kilowatt hour to get like this charge or charge so that those kilowatt hours. power from the system. It will remove those so you will be in the same situation as Joseph because for your grafts here there's a little bit. It's like this, so. If you got them sold in December, it'd be the same thing. You still have a pretty big bill, same thing for January. February and then March is when it picks up, you'll build up all these credits during the summer and then instead of that 1,659 kilowatt hours being billed to you. You won't draw that power from that. You won't be drawing that from your bank account. You'd be drawing this extra power from the extra charges that your electric uh electric that
Speaker 1:
you so like right here where it says total electric delivery cost. I won't be getting the delivery charge. Let's say come July if I get the system now. So, by July, I didn't have a $70 delivery charge.
Speaker 2:
That's why this is the best time to do it. A lot of people do it in the summer because that's when they're time and they're thinking about it, but then it takes a while to get installed. Now is the best time to get like the ball going because like you'll be most likely installed by summer panels turned on right when your usage is the highest and right when you're getting the most benefit. And when you get that um bill. It'll looks something like this, they just updated it, so it'll end up looking a little different by the time they get it, but all those positive values. On the pill hour you said. Mm They'll be negative and it's like, oh, those charges also go negative too because it's 844 kilowatt hours by that charge, but it's a negative 4 hours. So instead of all those being positive, they're going right back to you. And they have a format a little differently now since the end of last year, so it's like you run up a negative bill and you still end up paying $16 and they make it like a little bit more clear on that now, but it's like you'll have like your energy bank there credits that it'll draw on before it starts drawing.
Speaker 1:
So in other words you're saying that if I have a negative 6077, the bill, let's say the bill for that month here. Average charge is $20. They'll just take the $20 from there. But when I get the bill, it'll be, you know, $20 but it'd be minus $20. It'll be a negative $20. But I mean no that means there won't be no no electric bill for that month that I have to pay.
Speaker 2:
Other than the customer charge, and I, I, I don't tell people, I think, um, some people like when I'm, um, and this is a good thing for your training is like you don't wanna tell someone like, oh hey, you'll get rid of your whole electric bill or like um you'll pay a $0 electric bill. It's. The like And I could make it sound like that because it's like you're getting a 12% of your energy charges covered. That's why I try to say energy charges. You'll get all the electric fill hours like that'll all be zero, but then you're gonna pay $16 on top and it's like, oh if you get installed in the center. like Joseph did, and it's like, you know, you still get they build there and in January, February to get these credits, but at the end of the day, throughout that year, you'll create that many fill out hours which have that $3000 value.
Speaker 1:
So what you're saying is the district government to pay for everything to install the whole nine yards.
Speaker 2:
That's where the funding comes from, yeah. OK.
Speaker 1:
So if I want to get my roof coated, I gotta pay for that.
Speaker 2:
We give you a stupid idea on it. Because they don't, the roofer, they don't need to make um money on the roof because they can just get funding from the program and that's why the insol ROI is so good and it's like, but these people they got. They and there, you know, or so and this issue was before and after she did the so. We Let's see what kind of shape it was in. So that was the week before, not really great shape. That group over was like 7 g. And we just started that one. And your. And it was a bigger system system. Any more funding we can get, but they did like a really good job on that. And she's happy and when she got the solar shot which. That is put on the little brackets. Up here we take a lot of pictures if you wanna put it off.
Speaker 1:
I got a buddy. We do little projects. He, he likes that. We're doing some custom shells right now and he probably took about 50 pictures of 6 shells. So, so I can understand, you mean it's called covering your butt too,
Speaker 2:
yeah, I mean you need to do that. That's what I was saying like the permitting and like the turbal like
Speaker 1:
yeah I'm pretty sure if you do this, if you do this all the time in the district, they kind of have a little leniency about the permits and stuff like that, you know, you. There's ways that they, you know, but I, I, I used to deal with this type of stuff, so I know if you go down there 20 times a week you gotta finish projects and then they kind of, you know, yeah, OK. My neighbor back here just got sold. I don't know how long ago, but it, it just got it this year, right back last year, 24, I mean, yeah, 24.
Speaker 2:
No, I didn't see if we did that one.
Speaker 1:
Um, 1511, 15 11 free
Speaker 2:
to what. Mhm. Yeah. Mhm.
Speaker 1:
So I guess my understanding there so what I wanna make sure I'm understanding that. I get these pans pulling on me. I don't have to pay anything for them. So basically they y'all panels and y'all get all the electricity from anything over what I don't need, right.
Speaker 2:
Very
Speaker 1:
good.
Speaker 2:
Applies on all the power that's made, whether you use it or whether it's sent to the grid because if you use all that power, and in your case where it's like 102%. You're, you're gonna get like the most benefit. You're gonna use most of it instead of like a client that's like sending that has like a 300% offset and they're just constantly sending energy. They get incentivized on that full 16,000 kilowatt hours because it doesn't matter if if you use it or it gets sent to the grid, it's taking 1600 some kilowatt-hour load off of TEPCO and like dirty energy. And they at the end of the day what they're doing is they just wanna use your roof space to collect that incentive
Speaker 1:
right so that's what I'm saying so. So in other words, do we get to the point where My bill at the end of my at the end of the day, my bill shouldn't be no more at the end of the month my bill shouldn't be no more than about $20 a month is what you're saying. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
and you will get um just like just that spirit. You'll or uh in December you'll kind of get screwed in at the end of the year or the beginning of the year because what happens is if you have extra powers sent to the grid like if you end the year with a negative $50 balance. You don't pay for this, you own all the power and you have rights to it. PEPCO has to pay you for it because you generated it and you own it. So they'll send back a check for you at the end of each year with your last statement, and then it'll reset to zero. You, you'll always never have credits in January and you'll always still pay like half your bill for. For 2 months or so, but what that'll do is you'll end up sending more credits. You'll very likely get a check back at the end of the year which you paid these months. And that's why it's like these when I really get into these, it can be really complicated.
Speaker 1:
It actually why they just bank the money why couldn't they just bank the money? In other words, um. If I let's say, let's say you go back in and I, and I have a, I have a plus. Um, plus $100. Why couldn't they just take that $100 and say, OK, well, we know January is when we start, it's gonna be rough and just take that and put it on January's bill. here's why.
Speaker 2:
So the payback rate is like a couple cents less than the actual rate. So when you save it on your bill, you're. Saving, it's like it's putting them out of like 18 cents, but they only have to pay you back like 1314 cents. So when they, when they pay that back to you in a check, they're actually saving a little bit of money, yeah, and then it
Speaker 1:
makes you pay a uh half of January February,
Speaker 2:
yeah, it's like they'll, it'll like even out a little bit, but. There's like the little things they do that that would screw some people like the people that are um doing like 2 or 300% offset and sending a tongue to the grid, they would never like use any of those credits and they just build up this continual bank of power of like energy that they've sent PEPCO and never get like a
Speaker 1:
benefit from, yeah,
Speaker 2:
so. how it like back and forth works, but as the like next year if you add up all the or like once you have a full year of the system, if you add up all the uh charges from PEPCO and all the char the like savings like the 2 watt hour savings from the system, it'll about equal out at the 100% here. I, and I could be wrong though, like there's like if there's something I didn't see on the roof or like this is just like a a satellite drawing. That's why the um the first thing we do is that inspection we have up on the roof, we take a bunch of pictures, we get all the measurements, we come up with an engineering design and then. And all that like stuff we send it to PEPCO and it's like when we send it in it's gotta like look weirdly good and we have gotta have all our evidence that this is a good project and what we're trying to do is get approval from PEPCO to install and once we got that we'll get the permits. They're usually pretty easy after that. You'd be ready to install and by, you know, fastest is like 3 months or so, um, but I was I just tell people, hey, figure by by summer you'll have them in and gone I mean that
Speaker 1:
that would be fine because he's talking about so you're talking about January for March so it starts to get. Temperatures start to change. March April.
Speaker 2:
OK. And then, uh, once we have the pictures and stuff, I will ask them to. You'll have a quote for uh the coding, but we can definitely do that for under under the 900 number you have that's for sure once before.
Speaker 1:
Mm. He said you can pay for the call. No, he said he can help us work yeah
Speaker 2:
it would be a super good deal like they'd be like definitely less than $900 so off. Some people will pay like 2 or $30 for them, um, what we could do is probably put 500 bucks. Um, and I come back with a quote, and then, um, you can do that whenever you want and then that'll be it, but. Um, Let me see, because I think we're in February now. The. But we're doing first week if I. Are you
Speaker 1:
Uh, first of February, yeah, we go.
Speaker 2:
Um, uh, are you usually here in like the mornings or afternoons?
Speaker 1:
We, well, it depends on what day, yeah, we got doctor's appointments and stuff like that, but other than that we're here most of the time. Tuesday. No, that's the worst day, probably Monday, Wednesday. When you book your appointments. My appointments usually on Tuesday and Thursday.
Speaker 2:
I do Wednesday is pretty open. I we could do like 9.
Speaker 1:
And what you wanna do in it for the for the infection come on.
Speaker 2:
So, uh, the inspection we set up for,
Speaker 1:
yeah, we, we can do that. You said you said what time? We can do Tuesdays on that. We can do, we do any day on that. Um, but what time did you have? Cause my appointment is usually like 8 o'clock in the morning. So on Tuesday and Tuesday and Thursday 8 o'clock in the morning. After that, I'm usually back there by 10. So we do 11, yeah, OK, that'll work.
Speaker 2:
So we can do 11 and then uh all we do is I'll take a picture of your electric bill and just driver's license and then there's a 0 cent rate form that says hey, I'm gonna get the free power and this isn't gonna cost me anything and then that's it and then we wait till that Tuesday. Does that sound OK?
Speaker 1:
Yeah,
Speaker 2:
OK, I'll take, um, do you have all the pages of the bill
Speaker 1:
there?
Speaker 2:
OK Pictures Hm
Speaker 1:
So you work with PEO. I know. So PEPCO, for example, you,
Speaker 2:
uh, PEPCO or the city, like they'll, like they'll never come they're like they'll never come to your house like it's all like. Funded by them and then it's like private companies like us that make the possible. But we have to get it approved by them. We have like a
Speaker 1:
pere. I used to, I used to do like the gras. Oh, how so?
Speaker 2:
Like building weather models or.
Speaker 1:
Don't, don't we do this like what we used to do. We have a guy come by your house and do what they call blow door test. In other words, put a little thing in the doors come to the back and then we go to check all the windows and see what's, what's most drastic. If it's the windows, if it's the doors, and then we would spend, um, average about $2500 per household. So that means if your windows are bad, we will replace a couple of windows whatever we could afford. If it, if it needs to be all the windows, then we would work it out with that price and all the windows. And then if it's the door, we would we took the door, we would insulate like the hot water heater, water tights in the basement. Longest later added, we can do all that type of stuff. Wow, so that's that's how I used to see. And I just get all the to the week. It was part of crack. It was bread and vegetables. Wow,
Speaker 2:
and did
Speaker 1:
they
Speaker 2:
still do it
Speaker 1:
or? They, the problem is the people. The companies that I used to work for, most of them, um, they went out of business, and then they tried to get it hooked up to the Friendship house and it was another company that tried, we tried to get it through them, but, um, because the money is, is, is guaranteed, you know, they said we're gonna take a million dollars and we're gonna use for theization company well. Couple of these companies had never had that much money at one time. So when they got that money, they decide, well, I'm gonna take just the. stuff like that, so they're giving me work on this. I'm going out and doing this work and then when I go to turn the workers and they say, well, uh, we, we can't pay you right now, we're gonna have to work out some stuff. And we, we, I got burned pretty bad. So it was me and 22 other guys, one guy, uh, I got burned for about 6000 cause when it got to a certain point, I said, no, y'all need to pay me before I go and do any more. They said, well, if you go and finish. These right here, and we'll be good. And I'll be like, no, but you already owe me, you already owe me for 20 jobs and you want me to do 15 more. That ain't gonna work. So my buddy, it was summertime, so he was doing air conditioning and refrigeration. I mean, he, he got burned for like $30,000. You know, he went to Sears and he had set up this program with Sears and we, you know, we go and talk to a lot of these senior citizens and stuff like that. They ain't got no air, so we put 3 or 4 air conditioners in the window, refrigerator ain't working, we give them a new refrigerator. Did you phone with these guys? 00 they got sued. They end up getting sued. They ended up getting sued. But what the problem was. They owe so much money that uh like they owe, they owe Adam. They owe Adam's Bank in the millions of dollars. So Adam's Bank was like, y'all got some property up here that's worth some money. Y'all gonna sell it. So they were they was done. So by the time we, we, we, I mean we went to court and the whole nine y, and by the time Adams got their money, it wasn't nothing left. That's. So, so they popped out at the beginning and made it out. Yeah, because they didn't know, cause I know I used to work with arts. They knew how to manage the money. They, if, if they had. Um, the first house was young and young and they, and they spent it on a company. Well, I'm, I just use that as. I don't know what they expect it, but it wasn't it. The they already had the money set aside for to pay us. They should have never touched it, so they ended up taking that money and want to doing other things thinking well by the time we get the next check then we can straighten it out. But it don't work that way because yeah, the money is allocated. It's allocated. The the government and Pepco this money set aside for this program. I jail. I don't even know. I don't think so. I think once Adam's Bank got paid off, it was like a gun bill, you know, they went under, they told it, but they went under before then, but they, they, they got under so it was like things like that and you know, I, I just, I.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I, I wonder you just gotta check this out this stuff out and make like you're doing a good job being careful like
Speaker 1:
yeah
Speaker 2:
props on you,
Speaker 1:
you might, you might want to live with the organization that we work with sustainably. Really focused on like very high integrity, high integrity long term ways of thinking about business and building. Pro probably because you may have been knocked before like a lot of sore. They They practicing sometimes I can tell you whatever you need to hear. um, we're a small team we're really focused on. So what where I located? Where's the main office? OK. So what's the best number that you know um BA. Edwards E D W A R D S. Uh, 587. At gmail.
Speaker 2:
What do you do now?
Speaker 1:
Uh, um, I, I do little stuff, you know.
Speaker 2:
OK,
Speaker 1:
uh, we, we doing, I'm, I'm, I got a friend and he's trying to drag me back into to working every day. He does, uh. Um, exotic wood, so. We, uh, we just had a little project where we're doing, um, 2 counter tops and 6 shells, $18,000 so 100. 0 yeah, I love a cop. I was a copter before anything else and I went into business for myself. And um I probably had about a crew of 5 guys working with. Just got taught over there. That's a beautiful business though. I really think the trades are gonna come back in this whole time. Well, the trails are here it's just that they're all done by Hispanics now. I know like we had about 35 of them out here that hole out there. They were for and then they're renovating the house over there I I I've never seen 5 at the max over here, but they they work then the electrician is a black guy. I've seen an electrician. He's a black guy. He did electrical. I don't know what.
Speaker 2:
Um, I one of the uh. Uh, it's a power purchase agreement, which is the same thing you have with PEPO right now. I thought it's like you need to move, and a power purchase agreement is like I'm agreeing to purchase the power for this rate, and with PEPCO it's like you're agreeing to purchase it at whatever they say, and with the solar system you're agreeing to purchase all the power for a fixed 0% rate, it never goes up. It's a $0 system inflation. It's a zero sum electric costs. I have the estimated production on there. It's for 20 years, and we can actually extend that for up to 30 years for all the warranties and everything, and production. The guarantee on the panels is they'll be around 90% output at year 30 as they are at year 1. So for most people it'll be a lifetime guarantee.
Speaker 1:
So, so are you saying that 30 years is different? or you still produce the same amount?
Speaker 2:
They'll only degrade about like 10-12% in that time, so they'll be up there like way longer than 30 years, yeah.
Speaker 1:
I Then it will Oh no, I, I had some flare
Speaker 2:
up in the 90s. Oh Yeah So
Speaker 1:
do the panels increase the value of your house or decrease?
Speaker 2:
It's uh same thing as like if you remodel the kitchen and you have a nicer kitchen, that's gonna increase the value. Well, now it's gonna cost $3000 less to run the electric in this house, and that like savings amount will just grow and grow and grow because of the value of electricity is going up, but you'll still be getting it. In the system, so like even if rates never went up 3000 times 30 years is like 90,000. So like this house just got 100,000 less to like be if rates never went up to electrify it will usually increase the value of home. I mean, if you bought it, if you like spent $500 on solar, you could much more argue, hey, I put $500 into a solar system. Now my house is worth more than $50,000 or $500 more. I can't as much make that argument for solar. It's not gonna be like, oh I've saved $3000 on my bills, so like the house is gonna be $3000 more. It's not as always was. Whatever, you know, it's worth it to the new person. It's one of the top things that people are looking for in new homes is energy efficient upgrades. Um, dialysis and influences, so this is what you're getting out of this. We internment can repair system everything, no cost to you, all the equipment, everything, all the parts of the cans, all of it. The monitoring is set up for you as well. We usually do a Zoom with all our clients after the system is turned on, uh, which is usually a couple weeks to a month after it's it's installed on the roof. And you can get a map on your phone and see what he was doing and uh if you're tech savvy, you can do some really cool stuff with that software. We have that set up for you, set that up for you. The installer also has access to it, so if anything ever goes wrong, it's, it's 30 years. I don't tell everyone that like nothing's gonna go wrong for 30 years. If the panel went out or like if the inverter breaks, they'll know pretty quickly and it's usually done giving you a call and saying like, hey, like we noticed your inverter went out, can we come out like in the next week or two to replace that for you? And then as long as you don't hop up on your roof and starts. A with a hammer you wanna, yeah, it's like, uh, it's like, it's like when you, uh, like I, I rent an apartment right now so I can't go solar, but if the kitchen, if the kitchen sink breaks or like if my like, uh, like a ghost comes out of my toilet or something, I don't know.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I got it's backs up,
Speaker 2:
yeah, but I
Speaker 1:
put,
Speaker 2:
I put holes in my wall though because I installed a shell. So if I don't fix those, they're definitely gonna charge me for that because I, I did that myself. So that's like how they pulled it too. But we, even though we're not making roof penetration, you still get a roof warranty on it for the parts that we do with panels, and most importantly that 0 cent rate, that'll never go up, it'll never change, it'll never increase. There's no taxes, fees or anything like that because, uh, taxes, tax rate times 0s. Um, so that's like good,
Speaker 1:
uh, I got a situation where you come back and. In 5 or 6 months to say, oh by the way, uh, we do have to charge you for this, this and this. There won't be no charges.
Speaker 2:
Exactly what happens sometimes, so with the PEPCO approval, this. Only sets it up to be free if there were any charges like let's say it was a project where the roof was kind of shaky. Like when I set up and the other one, she was like, hey, I know I have a bad roof, and I'm like, OK, I'm gonna submit this as a free project, but when we do the inspection, they're gonna come back and they're gonna say we can't do this because it needs a new roof. If there are like upgrades or charges or anything. They can't proceed without your approval, so sometimes it's like, yeah, we come back and like they were interested in doing the roof, and I'm like, OK, I'll see if we can help cover it. And for that one we like work and she got a great roof and a good system out of it and then it was good to go.
Speaker 1:
I, I guess I gotta, I gotta make sure because I, I got a friend over here on 8th Street and she had solar panels on her roof and I know personally that it was a bad roof. And I told her before, you know, you need to have a new roof put on here before you put the panels on here, because I had been over there 4 or 5 times trying to patch this and coat that and every time I go up there and I take pictures and say, look, this is what's happening. You need a whole new roof. Simple as that, you know, I'm, I'm not gonna come over here and pass nothing else because this is what you need to do. And the next time I went over there, she got solar panels. I'm like, so you mean when they put solar panels over this over your, over a bad roof. Which don't make sense to me because as soon as you get, you know, a leak, do what do what's gonna happen? Yeah, how do you, how do you know like in your experience? When they start bubbling up. On, on a flat roof when you start seeing bubbles. Pray and then, and that means that you right because um the systems that they put down there, they glue that so everything should be flat, flat should be no buckles or none of that in it. If it is, there's something, something about it. Some something didn't stick right. Is that for flat roots? That's for flat roots. Most a frame roots are shingles. So you can look at the shingles and you can see if they start to curl up. If the shingles start to curl up, that means they, they need to be replaced. So, you know, situation like that, I, you know. I would recommend I, if I was doing your work, I would tell them no, we, because as soon as you, as soon as you put a hole over how you stabilize your. Things to hold the panels on it it's gonna leak, you know, it's definitely gonna leak because the shit.
Speaker 2:
And that's where you run into a lot of problems because what they were like, like maybe she didn't like wanna pay for a new roof or like have the money for it or who knows they're like, OK, we'll just slap them up there. That creates so many problems down the line like, hey, yeah, maybe it's fine now, but like when all those things happen, it's like all of these get warrantied. So if, if like she starts getting leaks because of how they mounted it because it wasn't a good system that's
Speaker 1:
all. That's what's gonna be said regardless on what it's leaking. Well, it didn't start leaking until you put your crankles on, you know, I, I mean, I hear that all the time in situations where we go in, we go electric, we gonna work on electric in the basement and a light upstairs goes on. Well, you know, it was working until y'all mess with the basement. You know, I mean, let's, let's be real. We'll, we'll check it out for you though, because I mean you ain't even call us nothing. When you get things hanging by a thread, yeah, maybe they're hanging together the moment you touch it that shows you it's broken it was already broken broken but they're not gonna tell you that. I mean, a lot of times they're gonna tell you that, you know, I had a situation to rero these guys basically. And uh we're doing some stuff in his kitchen knocking on the wall. He wanted to pass through like a pass through again, and we ran into a lot of lectures. So we, you know, put our boxes down, made jump boxes the whole nine yards. So we run upstairs and the guy said, well, that light was working, you know, to got clean. So we said, right, no problem. We said we're gonna check it out but maybe we didn't go up a wire down here in the wall. So we go through and everything else is working. We go up there and we pulled a light. The light was never hooked up, you know how when you get a new light or a new cord, it's got that little plastic that they already cut it. So you gotta just strip it off. That was still on it, so it's never hooked up. So we told we said, look, man, if you wanted us to hook the light up, just say, can you hook the light up, you know what I mean? but to make it sound like we did something and we didn't, you know, we, we should charge you for this. This should be a service shop, but we didn't, we didn't do that. We just let it go. But it's just, you know, you just like. Kind of it's kind of like why I thought, you know, got out of business as much as I was but people just instead of telling you the truth, they really lie to you and try to get something out of yeah.
Speaker 2:
And it's like if one of those companies is like, I mean there's there's a lot of solar companies that like hey like free solar is way easier to sell than like a $50,000 loan so like they'll set up shop here from they'll be like from Kentucky. There's this big company from Florida that's like doing all the permit poaching and like they like. Literally go around and like, but they don't have a ton of installs as soon as programs go like like this go away like Trump's gonna do everything he can to make sure they go away at some point like they're gonna not be in business anymore and who's gonna take care of them so.
Speaker 1:
OK, uh, that's all. OK, OK.
Speaker 2:
Last thing is the, uh, ID picture, and then they just have you initial on us for publicity so we can uh take pictures and put them.
Speaker 1:
Oh,
Speaker 2:
um, it's just so it's just so we can, uh, if you wanna do like a. Because sometimes I'll do like um testimonial videos and I always give um clients that do testimonial videos with me like uh. It,
Speaker 1:
it would have to be a year later for me to do a testimonial to say. That's very fast. That, that's now and I will do that as much electricity bills gonna have to where it's less than, I will, I'm gonna put it to you less than $50 a month. And then I, I'll do a testimony on it for you.
Speaker 2:
This fact I could if it
Speaker 1:
if it goes if like if it goes down if it goes down. I can get you more business. I can get you some business, yeah,
Speaker 2:
and we have a great referral program like we send you out $250 per referral, but. Don't do it for
Speaker 1:
we here we talk about putting solar past. She the one gonna probably take over. They broke the
Speaker 2:
Well, Biden's keeping all these, uh, was keeping all these programs cropped up, so. I don't go with. This is the initials.
Speaker 1:
How do you want me to read it? Um, you can
Speaker 2:
actually just dribble on the screen. The only thing different is it's just not gonna.
Speaker 1:
What tip? Yeah, what was she, um, want to know if you wanted Chick fil A. What today tonight you go to Chick fil A or you can call her. Huh, I thought, I thought they, they don't deliver. We're gonna call them, uh. So you're someone.
Speaker 2:
We're not some signatures. And then I'll put all your info into to the site survey scheduler, and then it'll send you a text and an email reminder and then you'll get an email from James Sheets, uh, probably next week, uh, when he's back in the office just saying like, hey, welcome to C, thanks for getting started, he'll send you a copy of all of this. really won't be any news till uh we come out on. Mhm. OK. So
Speaker 1:
That's right you have the money to pay you. Oh So you say you uh you say y'all in Union Union Market or inside the Union Market? Yeah,
Speaker 2:
it's an industrious building. It's like a co-working space. Yeah,
Speaker 1:
you're talking about a white building.
Speaker 2:
It's like
Speaker 1:
this is like a two story building across from the parking lot. It's from
Speaker 2:
the um.
Speaker 1:
Because we say union market, it used to be the farmer's market. Across the street from Gala College. We're. Let me find out y'all, y'all, y'all. Let me find out y'all sharing the guy from there. I the Northeast. Yes. It's raining on Huh?
Speaker 2:
This is uh
Speaker 1:
She probably
Speaker 2:
Uh, the TikTok headquarters are there.
Speaker 1:
TikTok and
Speaker 2:
they get the new office. That's like, oh I have
Speaker 1:
So what was this for? OK, that's right here.
Speaker 2:
It comes from that, yeah,
Speaker 1:
so
Speaker 2:
it's
Speaker 1:
here so
Speaker 2:
we get
Speaker 1:
I mean I don't know
Speaker 2:
we
Speaker 1:
can, but
Speaker 2:
it's a policy for the main incentive,
Speaker 1:
but there is a. Uh, credit which covers like 30% of it and there's a tax depreciation, yeah, we're like you know I asked the question. What would it fall on for him to, you know, the Yankees. I, I think I, I still think he's got to go through Congress before he can just do away with it. I don't think he can just, it's like Frannie he's gonna go on to Franie Mae and FEMA, you know, come on, dog. You don't know the thing the thing of it is is that. I hear what you're saying, but you gotta have something in place. You can't just do away with FEMA with all the tragedies and stuff that we had going on there. You can't just, you can't just come and say to the mayor out there, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, I think it's a good look for him, but he was talking pretty loud though. Yeah, you know, he's going out to Georgia and um North Carolina and saying we're gonna make sure that you get, you know, OK, well, FEMA, FEMA takes FEMA does that. Fingers's there, you know what I mean. Fingers there from the time it happens until the last trailer pulls out. Finger still in Florida, you know, I got buddies that work with FEMA, so you had um they interview a person, she's living in a. So put 3 kids. Thank It's also it's easy to punch down when you're not a problem solver yourself. I mean this is why John McCain went the other way because he wanted to rip out, you know, affordable Care Act. They didn't actually have something in place, you know, it's harder to change the stuff than it was and you said that about. Yeah, yeah, Obamacare. You gotta have something the replaces you can't just say I'm gonna take I'm, I'm gonna call Obamacare. that the people that's I, I think it's the same thing's gonna happen with the solar stuff because right now like, oh my God, so he, he's stupid because he's still, but he's still pressing coal. You know, they press some coal and they press some oil because he's not done that shit. But like I think the thing with solar is there's a lot of benefit to red states now for manufacturing. So even if he goes after a lot of the IRD, I think it's gonna be harder to without the stuff that's for solar actually, but we'll see. It could if maybe tomorrow if it's. But here again, I don't think it's something that he can just do because like he always talked about uh like Ohio. Most of the, most of the solo places now, that's where they go. They like Ohio. You don't think you're gonna try executive orders that are, but he he can say it, he can do it, but Congress still has to prove it. His executive orders don't mean nothing because the, the FEMA thing is just something that he, he, I mean not the fema but that. Deportation. You know that's just something that they're doing right and they was doing it anyway, you know. First of all, he was saying you know, but because of the deportation and all of that, a lot of farmers are not showing up for work because they're scared. That's gonna make grocery bills go up. He's like he's not gonna be so the tariffs. I don't know if groceries directly, but no, but it, it will, it will affect everything. We just,
Speaker 2:
uh, we just source uh American panel, so as soon as that media panel, so as soon as that happens, um, we're gonna go, we're like everything we're gonna do so. Most of us in America.
Speaker 1:
Well, I can understand, I can understand that going back to try to get made, but the thing of it is is that we have unions and all that stuff, and they all want to get paid $5. You look at places like C. My neighbor that lives out back working in caterpillar 30, 40 years ago. They was making $40 an hour back then with the union. So then you know they have to like $80 an hour. So what do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go to these states or go to these countries where they pay little or nothing, you know, and that's what they doing. That's what all big companies do. I don't care what they use Apple and everybody else. That's, let's go with China and all those other places because the labor is cheaper. We wanna, we wanna be unionized and we want everybody wants to make. Talk about, you know, that comes out or this is what got to happen if they really wanna. If they really want to make inflation and stuff come down, we gotta start with the oil. With the gas. What she's doing. No, not really. Let the gas is going back up. Well, not right, but, but gas is going down with in, in December gas is going down. Thanksgiving, December gas is going down. We're getting gas on like 280 a gallon. It's back up to $3.30 because Um, People control, gas oil is controlled by stock. OK, I got stock in oil and gas. I don't wanna lose no money. So let's check the price up. My buddies, I got rich buddies, they're all in the stock market. They're in the oil, gas. Just make it, make it go up if he expands the fly by drilling here. you know that. We, we, we right now are the no one producers of, of, of oil. Number one, out of the world. So I mean how when they're gonna get here, they still get it from me. He gonna buy all the stuff from Russia. That's my Well, Russia is a big. Produce a war that's, that's Putin is his number one buddy. I mean, he might not be said he might do some things to make it look like it, right. But that's where he keeps money and milk. I'm surprised, and he ain't quite figured out how he wanna do this, but he wants to stop the Russia and, uh, what's the other place, Ukraine. He wants to stop you. He wants to stop giving aid to Ukraine so Russia can take that oath. It's like when he said something stupid about we wanna take over Greenland. And, you know, he wants to make. Yeah, that's, I don't know the reporting says that the Dutch actually, depending on what exactly happened, don't think so because what they say is if if he. Then, then two they will stop. So the next place he will take his post. Yes, that's, that's way, that's the way that, yeah, that's what Putin who wants, he was on all that territory over there. I think that he learned a really harsh lesson from trying to take Kiev. I think that he wants the stuff that he conquered in the east of Ukraine, but I think that'll make a deal. Well, he, he, he has, he has, uh, North Korea helping him now, you know, you, you, you thought that you was just gonna go in and roll over Ukraine. Yeah, and you learned the hard lesson, man. You. I mean we're gonna see. We got, we got, um, what was it, uh,
Speaker 2:
can you check, I was just waiting for it to. Um, can you check if you got a text?
Speaker 1:
Oh, I just heard.
Speaker 2:
I was thinking maybe
Speaker 1:
oh you see if I got a text, yeah, it'll be from
Speaker 2:
the insult.
Speaker 1:
That It'll But this is the one that can take pictures of your ID and all that type of stuff.
Speaker 2:
Oh
Speaker 1:
yeah,
Speaker 2:
I've been trying to, well, doing all my work stuff and and personal on one phone was getting way too much, um, so I had to get a second one for, um, I keep this one just for all my clients, yeah. Um, so that'll be the best one to reach me. I'm just about to send you a text from it. You
Speaker 1:
just, you said one earlier because you said hi Sheila 301-661-5143.
Speaker 2:
For, oh, that was the one from Logan. That was Logan. So he usually sends out like a confirmation text. Let me reload this. Maybe it's not like in the,
Speaker 1:
so what I was saying is if we can lower the price of gas and then everybody take a step back because the situation is now once we go up we don't go down. You think about it, airline tickets not going down, um, they start charging you for bringing luggage, extra luggage on none of that's gone down, but the price of fuel went down, but the price of tickets, airline tickets ain't go up, you know. So you gotta, you gotta start to it. Yeah, so but you think if, if he, because how, how is he gonna explain it if he passes Keystone XL if we do all this fracking, all this drilling everything here, and then gas doesn't come down at all, how does he explain that? So I feel like he's he's gonna get with the companies and be like, we're gonna do we're gonna do like we've been doing. If I got an abundance of gas, yeah, I'm gonna sell it to somebody else. I'm gonna sell it to another country that's. If he, if he gets a ton of new drilling done inside the United States, he's got to bring the price down. Otherwise people freak out. Mark my words. If they do more fracking and more drilling. that oil to somebody else. I guarantees below 2. It might go, it might go down to, I think the lowest we got was like 270 down to about 270 now what was the lowest it was during the first term, first term? I, I wasn't really I couldn't I couldn't get you. I can tell you what it was back in 1958 the not the same, right? I mean back in 1976, I used to work in a gas station. gas was 43 cents a gallons when we heard that, when we had our first gas shortage, I think that's when the first time in the 70s was that is the difference though
Speaker 2:
is
Speaker 1:
that
Speaker 2:
inflation or is it more expensive compared to other stuff, gas.
Speaker 1:
That was due to uh inflation back then. Like when you think about what you were paying for gas groceries, how's that ratio compared to now it's um groceries is off the chain, you know, groceries off the chain. See one thing drives another because When the gas started going up in the truckers and everybody was saying, well, look, I can't transport this for this little bit of money that I was getting, you know, so we got. That we got jack the price up. So at that point, then the, the people who's making the stuff because they got to pay the truckers. So we got up the price. Yeah, half the truckers charge more. The other half go out of business, right. So then they do that and so now the situation is what they're doing now is that saying, OK, um, so everybody says, well, we want, um, minimum wage to be $15 an hour. OK, you got to think about these fast foods, when they, when they was in service, the purpose of these fast food. It was for kids to have a summer job. That was the purpose. 7 to $8.07 dollars an hour. That's big money for somebody that's in in high school last year in high school. OK, so now people raise their family. And then what they're doing is they say, OK. The same thing. Instead of giving them 4 pound of cheese, we will reduce the size of, of every rink. So you think you get the 4 pound but you, you really not. I mean just like. Who that? Communist check Uh, he's he, he, he's a black guy, very interesting guy who, who makes a lot of economic arguments about that kind of stuff exactly. What's your number 4722295104. OK. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
that's uh that's gonna be the best number to reach me, um, and I just said that like there won't be any news so after the site survey and then after the site survey, um, I'll probably have Martin, um, or some of the installer get in touch with you about the quotes and then, um. Yeah, we'll be good from there. If we're using uh funds from the uh solar to cover it, they usually do both projects at the at the same time. Um, so if you do wanna do it like right away, they have to be like completely separate projects, but if you're cool with us doing it, um, right, like around the same time, we'll come out, we'll schedule the roof work and then the after we put the coating out probably the next couple of days or a week after that, we'll do the installation depending on what the schedule looks like. Cool. Well, that's about it, um, from us for now. They'll see you on the 4th, and our whole goal is to make this entire process as easy and rewarding as possible. There's like 156 steps from today till we actually
Speaker 1:
when they look up their meters and stuff like that, it had to be out there by an hour. I like the meal.
Speaker 2:
So the like the inverter box goes usually pretty close to the meter mhm. And they'll run it up to the roof and then it's like, hey, if your meters in the back, it'll just go in the back.
Speaker 1:
No,
Speaker 2:
it's your main panel is probably right over there too. They'll check that out on the on the Tuesday as well. It's on the inside part, um, but they'll check that out. They'll hop up on the roof of the ladder. They'll take all these pictures, um, and then you. Out on your roof, so it's like, hey, we're gonna be good from there. So, uh, probably a good idea to, I've saved your contact in my phone. Uh, probably a good idea to save me is like Paul Solar or something. So if it's like a couple of months from now and, uh, you remember something, uh, you know who to look for and we have a, I have a whole team of people working, um. To get this done for you and all those steps because after the inspection, after we get the uh root coating figured out, I my goal is to kind of have you forget you even did it and then we're calling you up uh like towards the summer to schedule your install and it's like, oh wait.
Speaker 1:
So this is this one to number yours? 4 times. Oh,
Speaker 2:
the boy said. Don't do anything for scheduling your.
Speaker 1:
That's so that's all you.
Speaker 2:
That's ROI, um, and that's like an automated text from the installer, and that's what I was talking to, um, so you'll have microso over there and just get text by the installer if anything needs scheduled, you'll probably hear from. um, or her assistant or Ruth off or like extra things like 30
Speaker 1:
301
Speaker 2:
that's Logan. That's who uh Sheila met earlier and um. If you want, you can send him a text right now and say, hey, like thanks for stopping by earlier and uh
Speaker 1:
the phone. yeah,
Speaker 2:
and then uh. Uh, or I just mention the last other, uh, Martin might reach out on the roof thing, and then I have an assistant Mark that helps me some things sometimes, so I might introduce to him at some point too because we do, we do a lot of these. I do like 3 or 4 of them a day, and, um, I like to sometimes I like things fall. I like to make sure things don't fall through the cracks. So, um, you always have my number. Let me know if you need anything and. We'll take care of you.
Speaker 1:
So you, you saying that y'all pay for referrals? Yeah. What's the, what's what y'all I can be the spokesperson, right? Oh
Speaker 2:
yeah, when they get when they get info, um, we give you 250 bucks, um, but I'd probably work something out for people because I know a lot of people want the. Like the work done before they like tell their friends and that's like very fair but we gotta get all these applications in this year because if I think by summertime like if your project is one that like tries to throw a wrench in and instead of 3 or 4 months it takes like. I did have like one person out of 150 last year. He signed up in March and it took till December and like it was always back and forth. If you're that person and you sign up later this year, you may not get it. So we'll work out something with you if there's anyone you think you could introduce us to just like let me know the best way to introduce me. I love the email um introductions.
Speaker 1:
I like to do is I like to talk to the people. Yeah, I like to explain to them. My experience, and then I can say, well, I can give them your number and they can say call you up. So Bruce told me to give you a call about solar panels. I can do that.
Speaker 2:
That sounds great. Well, I, I, I gave up my last card today, but it was like my own number. When I get some, uh, new cards with my work number on it, I'll give, uh, I'll, uh, I'll try to stop back and give some to you, and, um, you just give them my number or email in the meantime. I'll send you, um. I'll just text you what my email is real quick too.
Speaker 1:
She ain't leave this.
Speaker 2:
Oh no. I think she went to get away. No, she would go out the back because we, uh, you told her we voted for Trump and she like she was bailed. Oh no.
Speaker 1:
At one point around here we had uh They was had on car tires
