Speaker 1:
I mean, I doubt she even does, um, but that was just like, yeah, it's like that was just a concern that she threw out, um. Yeah They always be coming up with new. Hey good afternoon how you
Speaker 2:
doing? But Yeah, Paul Logan, Logan, to see you again, man. Uh, this place is nice. Oh, I think a comfy chairs. This is awesome.
Speaker 1:
How long have you guys live
Speaker 2:
here? Uh, 2 years, 2 years this month. No, no, no, I'm sorry, we closed and then it'll be 2 years sometime this spring. Exactly why Uh, can I get you water?
Speaker 1:
Oh, yeah,
Speaker 2:
yeah, please, thank you.
Speaker 1:
I appreciate it. Great So you guys probably talked about the free solar stuff the other day. What did you say? Yeah, a little bit briefly. Did you meet like last week or
Speaker 2:
I think
Speaker 1:
it
Speaker 2:
was last week. Yeah.
Speaker 1:
Cool. Have you ever looked into like any of the programs that sort of
Speaker 2:
dipped
Speaker 1:
in
Speaker 2:
and out a little bit like when we first moved in, uh, I sort of poked around and got a couple. References to like different people doing it and uh typically those doing it in the sort of surrounding neighborhoods and what it looks like what sort of commitment was. Uh, and we sort of. We've not sort of, uh, you know, pulled any uh levers on it since, uh, or really gotten really deep into it mainly for reasons of like. Uh, you know, sort of. OK, we just spent a bunch of money getting into the house and setting it up, so it's not something we're gonna do right away even though we want to, uh, and then we're sort of, I think I mentioned it, we're juggling a little bit, uh, this year, uh, figuring out how long term you might be here. We've got, uh, we've got one son is 3, we'll be 3 soon and so he's about to start, uh, we're starting the process of like. Applying for and looking into pre-K in schools and all that, so that'll kind of uh maybe influence whatever long term plans we thought we had. We are reassessing, so like we kind of not really do much further into it because we're like, well, I mean, let's figure out if we're actually gonna be here for a long while because it uh. It, it was obviously a big commitment. Now I don't know, you all can tell me this, but you're not the first person who's come by and chatted to me about this at the house and other people who've been operating, uh, saying similar things. Has something changed with like the DC, uh, like DC's plans for this and ramping things up? Because when we looked into this both here and our previous house, uh, just sort of superficially like, OK, what would it look like, what is, how much is it costing people, uh. It looks, it seems like it was different, and now I, I feel like it depends what groups like groups like you all are coming around and saying like this is full steam ahead across the city and like there's a, there's a lot more support for people doing it and installing it whereas before it seemed like a bigger hurdle for individual homeowners to do because they would have to front some. Uh, or all cost depending on whatever they pursued. I don't know if something has changed and I'm, I'm ignorant of that or if this is just more people out here doing it.
Speaker 1:
Oh, it's always changing. Yeah, I did the biggest change is like from like 5 or 6 years ago. It was kind of I kind of like vision that like the wild west. Solar DC where it's like, you know, you really could only like pay upfront for it and like take out a loan or pay cash for it and then it was like they didn't have any standards of like hey like what kind of equipment are we putting on people's houses like obviously still gotta get everything permitted, but like it didn't matter what they were throwing up there. Um, so they passed the sustainable, uh, 2.0 DC plan. So I mean it is that all the equipment that we install houses is tier one equipment. So we're putting good stuff up there. It doesn't matter what company you're going through, they're gonna put good stuff up there. They're not gonna get approved for the incentives, right? And then, um, our organization CU, we actually started the free program about 3 years ago now. Before that, there was the Solar for All program which still exists, and that's directly through the DOE. It's. Like usually one of the first things that pops up when you Google Free Solar DC, but there's a, uh, income requirement. You got to be kind of on the poverty line or in certain zip codes. Um, so what our organization did is we organized these relationships we have with all the installation partners in DC and like investors to put the millions of dollars up to fund these projects, and we started offering it for free because the incentives are good and you know, hey, they pay for it, they get a good return on investment and. You know, if you're like most people and you don't know if you're gonna be here in the next 5 years or so, that's the best option because you don't put anything into it. You just get free power and they take care of everything, and when you move it's fully transferable,
Speaker 2:
right? OK, yeah, I think that's what it seems like it's just yeah I guess they just filled in some of that regulatory structure, filled it back in after saying we're gonna do this in 1015 years and yeah, everybody's the companies are filling it in as well,
Speaker 1:
yeah,
Speaker 2:
and a little more. Dispersed or uh yeah, not wild west, but like I remember two years ago specifically looking into this and it was like it's, it felt and seemed very different in terms of how it's been structured and pitched to individual homeowners. I'm pretty sure somebody from some organization came by at one point. Uh, offering like loan terms like you know, down the street, uh, for something like that. So
Speaker 1:
that's
Speaker 2:
what
Speaker 1:
it
Speaker 2:
seems like
Speaker 1:
it's changed, yeah, and that's another reason why we, our organization started because like for even since then there's been a lot of great installers here and a lot of great programs even before the free one existed, but it's like, you know, you don't want to go out and get like 12 different. Estimates from 12 different companies and like you know what's this one versus this one so we when we started, we started putting these installs through pretty much any every installer we could just to figure out who's gonna give the best experience and who's gonna make this the easiest and most rewarding for the families we serve and about now most of our projects go through either solar solution or ROY construction,
Speaker 2:
right? So you were just you were narrowing down your, your options, yep, yeah, cool, yeah. Well, cool, thank you for that that background. Yeah, like I said, we sort of looked into it, but we've never like become the full solar heads who like know all the stuff now that's like a full time job as you all know.
Speaker 1:
Oh yeah, that's, that's why we're here. Yeah, I totally understand but the cop thing, um, but also um. Well, they're looking in the past but looking in the future too. There's a lot of uncertainty about how long these incentives are still gonna be here. Currently, the funding for the federal that comes from the Fed from this in the inflationary reduction Act is frozen. It likely won't hold as frozen. Like it's gonna have to go to Congress and be voted on by both sides of the aisle, and it's a pretty bipartisan support thing. So we imagine I'll go to court or voted on or something like that, and it'll, you know, still be good for this year, but, you know, who knows when if you ever find, uh, a Crystal Paul that tells the future is, uh, please let me know. And then uh we can go win the lottery, but um, yeah, for now free solar is still available, uh, but the only way to guarantee you're actually gonna get it is to have it on your roof. So we're trying to facilitate as many of these applications as possible, and it's like, hey, we come out, we inspect the roof, get all the measurements, and then we come up with an engineering design. We send it in the PAPCO for approval and we send it into the city, and, um, lately they've been going through pretty fast, like, uh, Freddie McCray that we talked to and like. I think like mid December or something he's like install ready in like 5 weeks um so timelines are looking pretty good, but I tell most people like, hey, um, if you get your application in now you should have them up and running by the summertime when the bills are the highest anyway and as long as you got them up there, you'll be good to go if they get rid of the program before that install date, then it's like, OK, at least you tried, yeah,
Speaker 2:
yeah, yeah. Hope it wouldn't be that quick, but you know, who knows who know
Speaker 1:
lots of finger crossing,
Speaker 2:
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, cool.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, do you, uh, how do you get your electrical? Do you get like a paper on every log or do you pull it up on
Speaker 2:
your something on paper to us, but not my, uh, my wife typically, uh, uh, is in charge all this, but it's just online, but, um, yeah, but.
Speaker 1:
Well no worries if you don't got it right now. I can give you like a rough idea of Uh, What your savings would be,
Speaker 2:
I mean, I can pull, I have it. I have, I'm logged in, so like, oh, I can pull that and see.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, that
Speaker 2:
would
Speaker 1:
be
Speaker 2:
helpful here.
Speaker 1:
They put on the. On the 3rd page. OK sure yeah.
Speaker 2:
Yeah Right Last year was probably better in comparison than one month of this year. Oh well, they
Speaker 1:
actually put all of, uh, like on a sterco bill, even if it's like a recent month they'll put all the last 12 months of usage, and that's the most helpful for us that for us we can plug it in.
Speaker 2:
is You want me know OK, this might not work because it has to then pay my wife's phone for uh. I, uh Secondary Oh,
Speaker 1:
they can't make it too easy for you.
Speaker 2:
No, no, no, OK, so, uh, I can't get that right right now. I had it up, uh, I had it up before, but it's locking me out, um. But right before it logged me out, it was looking like it so. You know, we're like 70 odd dollars in like the low months and then it's peaking like I think last month it's uh we're we're like 130 or $140 for January and it's about peaking around that, maybe probably higher in like January, August or sorry uh July and August. Do you have electric heat? Yeah, oh OK, got you. Oh no, sorry, sorry, sorry, no, we switched the the water heater we're still on the older. Uh, gas, oh, sorry, we didn't, we didn't switch them.
Speaker 1:
And it's I looked at it
Speaker 2:
for sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 1:
Oh no, um, and it's so higher in the winter than in the summer.
Speaker 2:
No, it's, it's, I mean, it's obviously it's peaked, and I think this is probably because we had those two straight weeks of like 20 degrees, uh, probably popped that up higher than it normally is, but no, no, I, I had, I had like a year, uh, the yearly sort of analysis of on that when I was looking at it earlier and it was definitely July and August by far. Oh, OK, got you, peak months. OK.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, I'm just working with your roof space. You got a bunch of skylights. We'll be sure not to cover all those unless you want us to. Do you know uh when the last time you had the roof replaced was? Uh,
Speaker 2:
I
Speaker 1:
was
Speaker 2:
not even the previous homeowners, but it was, it's since the turn of the century, but I mean we're probably talking about 1015 years minimum. It was somewhere in that age, age range, maybe the early 0s.
Speaker 1:
It doesn't look too bad. Like, um, like for example, that roof on your neighbors, that one looks like a little more rough. Um, yours is like, uh, maybe that, that one up right next door to you is like that's pretty, looks like a pretty
Speaker 2:
good roof. I think that that should be pretty much new. They've been trying to refinish that house from like gutted for like a year and a half, so that's probably
Speaker 1:
pretty new. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
no, they haven't, they haven't finished it. They haven't sold it. It's been, it's been the whole thing. For a long time
Speaker 1:
like banging and drilling and not
Speaker 2:
really they've been doing that for like a month and then leaving for 6 and then coming back and doing so chip away, yeah, um, yeah, and I think uh my vague memories like obviously got that all inspected when we moved in again like this about 2 years ago now, and they told us the roof was looking pretty kosher. Uh, it hadn't been too, too long since it had been. Uh, replaced and we're still in the neck,
Speaker 1:
OK. Well, we do, uh, that's why we do uh roof inspection, um, anyway, if you had a bad roof and we go to submit this to uh for permits and the PEPCO, they wouldn't approve it, it wouldn't get funded, you wouldn't be able to do it unless we have like uh a signed like roof quote for whatever roof work you needed. Um, So, when we come back from the site survey, like that initial inspection, we'll hop up on the roof, like at the break a box, and all that stuff. If we find out that any uh upgrades are needed, like roof work, then we will come back to you and be like, hey, looks like um we need to make XYZ upgrades. Uh, we can always help pay pay for cost of those things, and if we find a way to like move like a way to move forward and great, but if it's like, hey, you wanna go solar, but it's gonna cost you like your entire roof, yeah, and you were planning on paying for that right now, then it's like, OK, at least we tried, you know, but. Cool, yeah, we just submit all these as, uh, we just assume that we'll be able to do it for free, and then if we find out that our assumption is wrong, then we kind of just go from there and. Uh, see if we can figure out a way to do it, and if not, then we do. Uh Let's see. And did your spouse have any like questions on it or
Speaker 2:
uh she didn't pass any specific ones along to me I think I, I sort of looked at this as like, uh, you know, information session to figure out like what is, what are, what are the steps in the process, what are, what is expected of us, what are we, you know, on the hook for if anything, um. And then you know we're we we would decide like, OK, do we do this even if we are unsure, you know, will we be here in like. 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, uh, and, uh. Yeah.
Speaker 1:
Well, that's the best part of this too, um, at least you just get the ball rolling. Uh, all you're committing to is we're able to do everything for free, then it'll just all be free. We'll proceed that way. If we find out that we're wrong at any time in the process, then you wouldn't have to proceed, um, but all you'd like be like everyone's like, oh, what am I getting locked into? All you're getting locked into is like, hey, you're gonna get free power from the system, free, uh, install. You'll never have to pay anything as long as you're not breaking it yourself, and they'll take care. Oh yeah, yeah, don't, don't get up there with a hammer or like you can walk on them, but don't jump, jump on them
Speaker 2:
like not yet been up on our roof in 2 years. I'm not, not, I have no plans for it.
Speaker 1:
Well, perfect, perfect,
Speaker 2:
um. You know, I uh. I, I understand if uh this is like opening the hood and you all don't sort of, uh, if there's any aspect of this where you're like, no, we don't talk about that necessarily with everyone, but is the is the model here is the way this works is that, uh, is my understanding, my basic one is that, uh, whatever like I forget the term for it, but the excess energy that is potentially storable and like transferable or uh you know, can be exchanged uh or sold back to PEPCO or uh again my terms I don't think are. Up to date here that's like that's what that's what your group companies doing this are getting out of this, right? Pretty much because I know individual homeowners could, if you just set it up yourself, you can so you can set something up with although although I imagine it's harder for individuals, uh, and I've heard or read things in the past where they weren't making it easy, uh, for a while. I don't know if that's changed, but, uh, that whatever excess energy you're, you're producing out of it can go back into the power system.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, yeah. So there's like whoever buys the system, they get they're incentivized to do that. So when you buy the system, Whether that's you, or whether that's the installer. Their benefit is that they'll get paid from the DC incentive as well as the federal incentive if it's still around, and that's pretty much how it works and then they just use that to pay for the cost of the system. And then the free solar, it's like this is how it works, they buy it, then they get all the incentives. You just get a free system and free power. And then you also get like if you send more to the credit than you use during the year, they'll send a check back to you. And that's why I plug in people's bills so I can see like, hey, are you like looking at getting a check from Petco or like hey, if it only covers half your bill, you just get the first half of your bill for free, um.
Speaker 2:
If that's something you can turn around real quick, I can see my wife's at work, so I'm trying not to bug her too much, but I can see if she can ping me that back in 5 within 5 minutes. Oh yeah, that's something you can plug in like quickly.
Speaker 1:
I sure can, yeah, if I have the, if I have to go, yeah.
Speaker 2:
That's Mhm I don't.
Speaker 1:
Where, uh, what she, uh, where does she work?
Speaker 2:
Uh, she works, uh, in a consulting group down like down in the West End. She mainly works at home, uh, but occasionally I have to go into work down there in DuPont.
Speaker 1:
And you usually work from home?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I'm finishing a PhD, uh, at, uh, Maryland, so I, I am shut up inside of either an office or a library. Oh,
Speaker 1:
sure. What's your thesis here?
Speaker 2:
Uh, it's about, uh, early American, as in like, uh, uh, like 18th and early 19th century. African Americans in like public sociable spaces, like taverns and the less licensed or uh uh regulated kinds basically what the political meaning of what people were doing when they were getting together to drink, dance, socialize, talk shit.
Speaker 1:
Yeah. What, uh, is there, have you found out anything interesting or are you pretty, are you like more towards the start of it or
Speaker 2:
more? I am, I am very much towards the end of it, but it's a finishing line unfortunately, but hopefully this calendar year we're I'm done. I've done loads of really interesting things, yeah, uh. If you ever think about doing this, go nearer though. Is a bad idea in terms of trying to run to like 12 to 24 different archives in multiple cities, not a smart decision, but yeah, anyway, so I may, I'm pretty much working out of home and or a library of Congress every day, yeah.
Speaker 1:
Um, before. Let's see what we got for
Speaker 2:
this. Right.
Speaker 1:
Sure space looks like it would be good for her. 89,0006 kiwatt hours. Her electric.
Speaker 2:
Um, so
Speaker 1:
power savings should be $1600 1700 dollars, um, if we're able to do about the design, um, that your space could hold, um, and that would pretty much be it. Um, you just get the savings every year and it's like, hey, if you use $2000 power and you just draw that last $300 from EPO, if you only use like $1200 of power, then you'd be getting a couple $100 back um at the end of the year from PEO.
Speaker 2:
I mean. I am no mathematician. Um, but just based on what I was poking around and looking at earlier that that might cover, uh, most of our knees because that, that might be like. Even a little above our average like per month, uh, bill, uh, taking into account the sort of the lower end of the, the, the year, yeah, the lower months of the year, so
Speaker 1:
yeah, yeah, I mean, I would say average usage like for a house like this, it's like, you know, between maybe 7000 kilowatt hours a year and 12,000 ki hours a year. So I wouldn't be surprised if that's covering most or all, maybe a little bit more of your, yeah. Yeah, most people, it's between like 1500 and 2500 and um kind of hope PEPCO doesn't downsize it or anything or throws a wrench in it, but if everything goes how it should, then that's like about what it would be. Um, that's why the inspection is so important because we gotta make sure that like, hey, we can actually do this design and like when we send the engineering drawings into PEPCO, it's like, hey, is this gonna be, you know, how it's gonna be as installed and then we just kind of go from there and. That's uh pretty much how it works, and then if there's any changes after the inspection, uh, we have to come back to you and let you know if there's any upgrades needed. We have to find a way to uh solve those to move forward, but. Yeah, should be good. Maybe there will be a roof thing we have to do. Maybe not, um, you're just finding that out on the, on the inspection. Yeah,
Speaker 2:
hopefully, hopefully not, like I said, nothing, nothing alarming came out of the inspections two years ago.
Speaker 1:
Yeah, and yeah, again, it doesn't look too bad like,
Speaker 2:
um, I know we lose a little bit from the skylights, uh. Yeah, it is. Oh
Speaker 1:
yeah, otherwise it'd be a pretty decent size system. It's an average, like average size system. It's like 7.5 kilowatts. It's pretty average, um, but if you, uh, if you didn't have any skylights there, it'd be, it'd be pretty nice, but. Hey, even I have people that do this, and they're only covering like 20% of their bill, so it's like, OK,
Speaker 2:
yeah,
Speaker 1:
it's one I was using, uh, where did you have Antoine Wade or was that Charlie? I, I think I was with Antoine. He, uh, they're using 29,000 kilowatt hours a year. Wow, out of a townhouse. Electric he 00 yeah, that's great and you have like 8 people living there, so
Speaker 2:
OK, that'll get you are they growing something in the base? What the hell is going on here? Oh yeah, that's crazy.
Speaker 1:
I have this other family in uh in like Bloomingdale, they reasoned about the same, and they did, it was like, you know, hey, 25% offset of your bill, like, and they, but they were only there like half the year, didn't have electric heat, and they had like no idea why their usage was that high. I'm like, your usage is like over triple what normal is, like you have no idea what's causing that. It's just like there's just 3 people live here, they're like, no, I'm like, OK,
Speaker 2:
that's crazy. Can you get that high even if it's just like maybe there like was it an old house, you know, there's leakage there's, you know, we need to get one of those uh diagnostic tests of like where all the air is getting in and out of your house like could that could that could be high up
Speaker 1:
and
Speaker 2:
it
Speaker 1:
could
Speaker 2:
be like
Speaker 1:
I feel like if, if it was that would be like we do that inspection and it would just like check all the boxes not to get it that much but I know. Something that like really jumps it up is like the little electric heaters or like the like even the really nice ones that like they make it look like a fireplace and it's like really nice like rules will make your winter bill higher than your summer bill um even if you don't have electric heat, um, and I don't know, maybe there might have bitcoin or something like that. But you're good over here,
Speaker 2:
yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, the time window has ended and my wife hasn't responded, so she's probably in some meetings.
Speaker 1:
Um, so yeah, if, uh, do you think you and her would be opposed to setting up an inspection like a week or two from now, um, we can come out, get everything done. Um, obviously we, uh, you could, we, we have a week or two, so if you send me the bill before then, that'd be fine, uh, but usually we just take a picture of the bill, uh, we send in a picture of your driver's license to PEPCO for the PEA application, and then we just sign like a zero cent, uh, rate form where like, hey, I'm getting this for free and we're getting all our power for free. Do you think that, uh, you'd be post that today? Let me say a
Speaker 2:
contingent yes just because like I'll chat to my wife but I didn't see, you know, we weren't this is, you know, you come to the door with the prompt for even thinking about this. We haven't, we haven't sort of talked about it in a long time, so. Um, but yeah, I mean, it seems very straightforward.
Speaker 1:
OK, sounds good. I could even, um, because you, you, both of you should definitely talk about it. Uh, if you need to talk about a little more, I could just give you a call, uh, a call like later tonight. I'm usually working until like 8 or 9. is there a time that she's like, like, do you guys both get done with the work at like. 6
Speaker 2:
usually, but usually that's when she's not gone into the office, so I'm not sure what the rest of her day her day looks like, uh, maybe like tomorrow or the day after.
Speaker 1:
I can just give you guys a call like tomorrow evening. OK, cool, and then I can send you a text too in case, um, you guys both connect, uh, before then. Let's see Is 202-341-5086 a good number for you?
Speaker 2:
That's awesome. 6. And I kept trying to reference it after recheck last week, uh, I realize I kept forgetting it. What did remind me the name of your, your organization again? Sustain you sustainable, OK.
Speaker 1:
Leslie, we have a friend. Yeah, I think mostly I think we're a little bit there. Oh, is it? OK. This is the good area though, this is where I have the most people.
Speaker 2:
Um, Oh,
Speaker 1:
I think yeah that's smart. Oh, you're like right on. We gotta fill out this part now. We got everyone over here. Leslie's over there. I've been chatting with uh Beth too a little bit so. OK, I wasn't sure if Leslie was the one. Unless you sure she's on the spot or not. Yeah, some reason this like little area northeast, I don't know why everyone there is just like the highest density of people doing it. There's like this little section here in northeast and then this little section in northwest is kind of similar. It's like, I don't know, it's kind of interesting to see like where people are doing it more a lot.
Speaker 2:
There's a there's a there's a sociology thesis. Behind behind this map, yeah.
Speaker 1:
We've struck out in in Trinidad, I think I've only done like 4 over there, a bunch of appointments, but.
Speaker 2:
Free solar seems a pretty easy sell. I mean, I know you gotta get stuff put on the roof and everything,
Speaker 1:
but you know the hardest part is, is, it's, uh, getting people to believe it's, it's actually a thing because like you've looked into it before and it's like, OK, things have changed, but a lot of people I talked to, they've never looked into it before it's like. OK, like, if, uh, like, yes, if someone comes to your door and tells you something is free, you should definitely be skeptical, but it's like, hey, they're free solars they literally all it is is they just want to use your space so they can collect that and send it from DC, and that's pretty much it,
Speaker 2:
yeah, I think, uh, I guess that's, it shouldn't be surprising me about. Yeah. And people not being so aware of it, I mean, like I, I, I saw this figure or I was reminded of this figure like I've, I've seen it before, uh, maybe I couldn't have recalled it instantly, but like, you know, currently or turn of this year, like wind and solar is now like across the board half the price of fossil fuels. And I figured if you ask like 100 Americans like 2 would would would even be in the ballpark of like yeah that's yeah that's that's how much those things cost.
Speaker 1:
So it's crazy and like you see um like even with like the new administration like a lot of people. Make the clean energy a more like a political thing and it's like, OK, you can do that, but it's like I don't care what someone's politics are, it's like just cheaper to like do things that are more sustainable than less sustainable. Well, Texas
Speaker 2:
does that, right? Isn't Texas is like they actually have the leading like wind, uh, uh, production in the whole country, the building of solar like 40% of their power from wind,
Speaker 1:
yeah. And they, they have like the, um, their grid is, is disconnected from the national grid. So they also have, you also have an illusion of choice there with your electric company because there's like 60 different electric companies, but it's all.
Speaker 2:
That's too many peanut butters. I do not need that many choices. Oh, it's exactly that. Yeah, but again, you would never assume that about Texas and that they're actually getting so much of their very cheap energy from.
Speaker 1:
Oh yeah, I, I, uh, I used to work there a little bit in Houston, um, and it's like you talk to people about solar there and like everyone works in oil and gas there and they're like, I'm not going in solar, I work in oil and gas. So it's like, hey, you're already, we're already getting like most of our power here from renewables like. Yeah, they were great together. I,
Speaker 2:
I'm surprised they're agnostic about it. Like I would have thought more people in Houston would be like they, they, that they are the threat. When solar are the enemy. We have to kill them.
Speaker 1:
Oh man, well, there's a lot of you here, so
Speaker 2:
I imagine, yeah.
Speaker 1:
Uh, OK, I'm just sending you a text right now. I'll give you my card too.
Speaker 2:
Yep, got it, and then. Uh,
Speaker 1:
Even if you find the bill before um you get a chance to chat with her, I'll send it over I'll do that.
Speaker 2:
Oh What is and what, uh, you said the typical turnaround for permitting is about 5 weeks or is that uh I'm gonna be saying that I can't remember if that was,
Speaker 1:
it's hard to say um lately we've been getting. The two things that can hold it up is PEPCO approval and Department of Buildings issuing permits, and sometimes it's lightning fast like on uh for praise, it was like I think like 10 days for PEPCO approval, but about a month or so is like standard, which is OK, so either get them done quick. Can we expect that to continue or we'll go back to like 2 months or like we don't know and then it's like that's assuming they don't throw a wrench in it. I usually tell people 3 or 4 months is a good expectation. Um, and then, like, hey, by summertime, like you probably have them, uh, on and
Speaker 2:
there's not delays, but there's time involved, but you know, I was looking to your contractor and getting them given the time for them after that
Speaker 1:
and it's like our business has like tripled this, uh, past month or two because like there's some people, yeah, well, it's like a lot of paperwork and stuff for me, but um I imagine like you know 3 months from now our install we've been like ramping them up. Like insoles get quicker when it's, uh, warm out, so it's like we're gonna have more capacity we're gonna continue ramping that up, but I imagine we'll keep, uh, like we'll probably be outpacing like a little bit ahead of our install capacity, which is a good thing, um, but it's like, oh yeah, if we're backed up and you're like, you know, 50 in line, 50 in the line to get installed, it might take a little bit longer. There's like I signed someone up in March last year and there was just back and forth, back and forth, back and forthep go all summer and didn't get installed until December. But I mean he was so cool with it. He paid cash for he paid like 500 cash for the system. He didn't, he didn't really care, so like I don't know, but, uh, most people, uh, I don't like couple months is pretty expectation and then there's any, um, like back and forth or anything that's like holding up a little bit, we'll let you know, but that's also why it's important to get the applications in so we can get the ball rolling as as possible in case your project's gonna be one of those ones,
Speaker 2:
yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. Yeah, OK, yeah, I mean that rings true. We used to, we used to run bars, uh, in DC, uh,
Speaker 1:
oh really?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, uh, it's it's been a while now, but. Going down to get the permits for. We have, we, we have worries all those permittings, not always delays, but they're always surprises. You get quickly, it's a surprise.
Speaker 1:
They can't make it
Speaker 2:
too easy. They can't make
Speaker 1:
it too easy. But that's also like where we come in. Like my, my whole goal for my clients is just to kind of like. Hey, we'll send you an email when it gets approval. We'll send you an email when we get all the permits back and then we'll give you a call when it's ready to be scheduled, and we'll pick a date with you. So you might forget you even did it and like, you know, who needs another home project to worry about. So we try to make it super easy for you. And then, um, go from there. Yeah, cool, yeah, is there anything else I can do for you while you got me here?
Speaker 2:
Uh, no, that springs to mind. Uh, you said you had a car.
Speaker 1:
Oh yeah, I was looking for it. I'll have my box at home, um, but that's my number. That's the best way to reach me anyway,
Speaker 2:
um, and then, OK, perfect. Paul, right? Yes.
Speaker 1:
Haircut. A clifford, like the bigger red. I'll save you your contact too so if you reach out. OK And if you guys need more than a week or two, if you guys have other stuff come up, that's like totally fine, we try to get these, um, wrapped up pretty quick, um, but if you guys need more time for any reason, we'll, um, keep in touch with you. Uh, my friend, our friend, good friend mine who, um, helps us out a lot with a lot of these too. Uh, we'll take care of you, um, whatever your timeline is, but, um, hopefully you should be able to get your application in and. Uh, your schedule, you good to go.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, cool, sounds, it sounds promising. This is, uh. OK. I'm glad it's easier. Yeah, well, if
Speaker 1:
it's possible, we'll get it done
Speaker 2:
for you. Oh
Speaker 1:
Next time I come back I sit in that chair
Speaker 2:
that's a pretty good one. That's a good one. That's nice. I love what you did. He, uh, we were over at a friend's house that's actually from our friends who live in the down down the street, uh, and he just all of a sudden the day we were playing over there and he was just like, this is the only thing in the world to him. So they lent them to us and like every day.
Speaker 1:
They're
Speaker 2:
the best. They're like tires, different shapes, they're like almost flat, but they just, they set up all these magnets around them like. I don't know, you know, do that with a 3rd 1 you have off the top of the washing the monument and you build a tower underneath you and build whatever you want,
Speaker 1:
OK. I don't like it. Oh, I forgot to take off my shoes. Sorry about that.
Speaker 2:
I didn't. There was no there was no mandate. I would like to see you too. Thank you. Talk to you soon. Have a good one. Oh, OK, OK. I don't have impression. Oh yeah, yeah, I want to do it. Yeah, OK. Yeah
Speaker 1:
